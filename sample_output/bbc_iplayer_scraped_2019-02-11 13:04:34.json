The country is an eco-paradise, not just in the water, but on land as well where 80% of it is forested. But the country has recently introduced one of the most destructive agri-businesses in the tropics - palm oil farming. Ade discovers how Gabon hopes to do it sustainably. The country has impressive environmental credentials, but on a tour of its divided capital Ade hears that some people are skeptical. One critic suggests it is a way for the country\u2019s autocratic ruler Ali Bongo Ondimba to curry favour with the international community. ", "Next up is perhaps the most chaotic and corrupt country in Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo.

After going on a tank patrol with the UN, he meets Kibomango, a champion boxer who is helping to rehabilitate some of the country\u2019s 30,000 child soldiers. ", "Travelling into one of the most famous national parks in the world, Virunga, Ade discovers that few areas of the country have been left unscarred by the violence. And the impact on the wildlife has been extreme, as Ade encounters some of the world\u2019s few remaining mountain gorillas. ", "His final stop on this trip is Uganda where he meets Bobi Wine, one of Africa\u2019s most outspoken political campaigners. Bobi was recently arrested and beaten, and his driver killed, after his protests drew the attention of long-standing dictator Yoweri Museveni.

Built by the Romans, this Christian Cathedral has survived earthquakes, riots, sieges and conquest to become a mosque and now a museum. As Michael explores, he reveals the ingenious solutions that enabled this awe-inspiring church to survive 1,500 years of turmoil. As Istanbul, once known as Constantinople, was built by Emperor Constantine to outdo Rome itself, Michael goes in search of the mighty city the emperor built - Constantinople. Michael discovers that Istanbul is built upon layer upon layer of history and culture, one era's buildings erected on top of the other. With the help of local archaeologists and experts, Michael delves into some surprising spaces, such as the once enormous Hippodrome. It began as a stadium for chariot racing but its foundations were later converted into a huge water cistern to supply the Emperor's Great Palace. Michael wades through its foul-smelling water to uncover the Hippodrome's secrets.", "With many of the city's most extraordinary places concealed, out of sight or underground, we turn to the latest 3D-imaging technology to reveal them.

Pioneering her own distinctive brand of 'magic realism,' works like The Magic Toyshop and Nights at the Circus cracked open the middle-class conventions of the postwar novel and influenced a new generation of writers.", "Yet in her lifetime, Carter's fierce politics, frank exploration of gender and fondness for the supernatural unnerved the macho literary establishment. She never won the Booker Prize or received the staggering advances of her male contemporaries - and regularly struggled to pay the bills, despite creating the acclaimed film The Company of Wolves. Four decades on, Carter's powerful tales of desire, fearless women and monstrous sexual predators have never felt more relevant. As Jeanette Winterson says in the film: 'Every woman writing now has a debt to Angela Carter whether or not they have read her. She was ahead of her time. And that's why we're so interested in her now because she's coming into her time almost prophetically.'", "Narrated by Sally Phillips, this film is a dark and delicious foray into Angela Carter's extraordinary life. While Carter's early work drew on her creepily claustrophobic childhood and miserable early marriage, it was her experience of living in Japan in the 1970s that liberated both her writing and her sexuality. And she continued to live out of kilter with polite society - horrifying critics with expletive laden put-downs, falling in love with a teenage builder in her 30s, becoming a mother at 43 and, tragically, winning the reviews of her career for Wise Children, the week after her death at the age of 51.", "Made by the team behind The Secret Life of Sue Townsend (Aged 68 3/4), with animation by Emmy Award-winning Peepshow Collective, this film is a visual treat inspired by the surreal imagery of Carter's fiction. Hattie Morahan plays the young Angela (with extracts from unpublished letters and diaries), while Maureen Lipman, Kelly MacDonald and Laura Fraser read from Carter's fiction. Including rare archive and family photos, with contributions from Angela's friends, family, students and admirers - including Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie, Jeanette Winterson and Anne Enright."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Saturday", "time_last_aired": "00:05"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": null}}

But now, extraordinary newdiscoveries around the world are overturning that idea. Antony is going to travel across the globe, and thousands of years back in time, to piece together a new story of how art began. He discovers beautiful, haunting and surprising works of art, deep inside caves across France, Spain and Indonesia, and in Australian rock shelters. He finds images created by hunter-gatherers that surprise him with their tenderness, and affinity with the natural world. He discovers the secrets behind the techniques used by our ancestors to create these paintings. And he meets experts making discoveries that are turning the clock back on when art first began.", "Finally Antony asks what these images from millennia ago can tell us - about who we are. As he says, 'If we can look closely at the art of our ancestors, perhaps we will be able to reconnect with something vital that we have lost.\"'."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Fri 1 Feb 2019", "time_last_aired": "00:15"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": null}}

It is out with the old and in with the new as they leave behind their 1960s secondary modern and embrace the experimental 70s and a comprehensive.", "In their first lesson, the boys and girls are finally mixed, as they learn about commerce and air travel, complete with a life-size model plane structure in the classroom. Role playing sees some of the class try their hand at being a pilot, air hostess or air traffic control, while others are confined to being the passengers and commenting on the service! Most of the class board a Midland Red bus and depart for a special school field trip to an iconic local attraction \u2013 Spaghetti Junction. Health and safety was taking a back seat in this decade, and our modern class experience the highs of a trip to a motorway site, to count the passing traffic.", "Meanwhile, three pupils have been detained at school for their fashionably rule-breaking long hair. They use their time to form a union, aimed at fighting back against the teachers. In 1973, thanks to the bold demands of the Schools Action Union, this comprehensive becomes a free school \u2013 and abandoning the rules has the teachers more than a little worried! The first thing to go - school uniform, followed rapidly by punishment. Our class does as 50% of Birmingham\u2019s schools in this period did, as they join together for a home economics lesson. Today, it is curry on the menu, and despite never having cooked before, some of the boys improvise with their recipes - risky, given that everyone is eating it for school dinner! And judging by the level of culinary skill, the teachers might have bitten off more than they can chew.", "After the delights of ten bowls of curry, the pupils are in for a treat as they learn how to play the steel drums. Mastering the art of both musical performance and dancing, they put on a show for their friends and family in the school hall.", "Changing attitudes in the 70s mean that our class are taught progressive new ideas. Embracing diversity, dissecting the words of Pink Floyd, complete with incense burning, and digging up worms on the school playing field, are all part of the unique experiences they have in this decade, as they find out just how radical and experimental school could become. And if it is all just too much, they retreat to the sanctuary, a room of palms, throws and lava lamps, to chill out. As the decade draws to a close, our pupils and teachers are joined by friends and family for the end of era disco, and this time they have new groovy new lights and a hot soundtrack to enjoy. As they embrace the spirit of Saturday Night Fever and boogie on the dancefloor, they reflect on their experiences of the 1970s, a decade of more freedom than they\u2019ve ever experienced before."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Friday", "time_last_aired": "02:15"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"m0002fpz": {"title": "Episode 5", "episode_no": "Episode 5 of 8", "synopsis": "\n5/8 In the experimental 1970s, the free spirit of the era creeps into the classroom.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0002fpz", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Mon 01 April 2019, 20:00)"}, "b0c13s5c": {"title": "Episode 4", "episode_no": "Episode 4 of 8", "synopsis": "\n4/8 In the swinging 60s, the class try bricklaying, typing and even a spot of Mini driving.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c13s5c", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Mon 01 April 2019, 19:30)"}, "b0c07bl4": {"title": "Episode 3", "episode_no": "Episode 3 of 8", "synopsis": "\n3/8 Deportment, debate and even dancing are on the menu in the postwar era of rock 'n' roll.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c07bl4", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Mon 01 April 2019, 16:00)"}, "b0by4v9h": {"title": "Episode 2", "episode_no": "Episode 2 of 8", "synopsis": "\n2/8 The class learn bizarre new languages, test the latest gadgets and run wild in the woods.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0by4v9h", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Mon 01 April 2019, 20:30)"}, "b0bx7lxt": {"title": "Episode 1", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 8", "synopsis": "\n1/8 The class experience life as Victorians in this extraordinary time-travelling adventure.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bx7lxt", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Mon 01 April 2019, 17:15)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {"m0002jvr": {"program_title": "Episode 6", "series": "Series 1", "program_synopsis": "6/8 The class embrace the new world of the 1980s, with robots, early computers and synths.\n(R)", "program_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0002jvr", "channel": {"name": "BBC Two", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo"}, "broadcast": {"date": "22 Feb 2019", "day": "Fri 22 Feb 2019", "time": "00:30"}}, "m0002fpz": {"program_title": "Episode 5", "series": "Series 1", "program_synopsis": "5/8 In the experimental 1970s, the free spirit of the era creeps into the classroom.\n(R)", "program_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0002fpz", "channel": {"name": "BBC Two", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo"}, "broadcast": {"date": "15 Feb 2019", "day": "Friday", "time": "02:15"}}, "m0002pbm": {"program_title": "Episode 7", "series": "Series 1", "program_synopsis": "7/8 The class arrive in the 90s, ready to embrace girl power, Brit pop and the Gladiators.", "program_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0002pbm", "channel": {"name": "BBC Two", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo"}, "broadcast": {"date": "21 Feb 2019", "day": "Thu 21 Feb 2019", "time": "20:00"}}}}}}}

The team started at school four years ago when their only experience of cricket was their dads and brothers watching it on the TV. In spite of this, they took to it like naturals and began winning all the tournaments they entered.", "All of the girls have had to fight to be part of the team. They have faced backlash from some of the local Pakistani community, for whom cricket is strictly a boys' sport. Some of the parents don't want their daughters staying out late to train. They have been told that girls should stay at home, study and help their mums with the housework. They've had to prove to their male peers that girls can play sport too. Plus, the team have had to play in what is an otherwise all-white, elite schools girls' league, facing prejudice and proving themselves as the underdogs. At one of their matches, the other team laughed at them for wearing headscarves and refused to shake their hands. ", "When asked what gives them the edge over their rivals, they say 'adversity'. Because nobody wanted them to succeed, they've had to work together as a team more closely than their more privileged peers. They look out for each other and overcoming the obstacles from every direction has brought them closer together. For some, the cricket pitch is the only place where they feel like they can be their true selves.", "The team has taken a break for their GCSE exams, but once the summer holidays start they are back on the field to train for their last tournament together. After the summer they will all be going their separate ways, all going to different colleges. The tournament will be held at the legendary Headingly cricket stadium and they will be playing some of the best girls' teams in Yorkshire. Hami is their coach leading them to victory. It is their final chance to prove themselves as Yorkshire girls' champions and they want to go out with a bang.", "The film is narrated by Zainab, who is the team's star bowler. A high achiever, she is predicted top marks in her GCSEs. She knows once this summer is over she is going to have to concentrate on her studies. She wants to be a lawyer, but her dad, Sajid, has other ideas for her future, preferring her to be an optician or dentist. Plus, he doesn't like Zainab leaving the house without a chaperone so she is struggling to get to the training sessions to take advantage of her last summer training with her beloved team.", "Hanfia is the dark horse of the team. Always wearing all black hoodies and ripped jeans, the others tease her for being a goth or emo. She used to get into a lot of trouble in school leading to her getting kicked out and only came back to play cricket. More of a creative than academic, Hanfia is looking forward to going to Art college in Leeds to meet people who she can fit in with better. And her mum Sameena just wants the best for her.", "Most of the team are from Pakistani backgrounds, but Jasmin's family are Rohingya and fled persecution from Myanmar. She was born in a refugee camp in Bangladesh just after her father died. After starting a new life in the UK nine years ago, tragically her mother was in a car accident, leaving her partially paralysed. Now Jasmin, along with her four siblings, care for her mum who cannot walk or feed herself. A natural sportswoman, Jasmin was scouted for a football scholarship at one of the best schools in America. But her duty to her family and looking after her mum meant she turned it down. The cricket team helped her through this difficult time, giving her a space to be a teenager again. Looking after her mum is Jasmin's top priority so this summer is her last opportunity to play sport with the team that gave her so much.", "Cricket means so much to each of the girls for different reasons. It is their freedom and independence. It is their rebellion against what is expected of them. But it was the structure of school that bound them together and made them train every day. It was their excuse to be out of the house without their parents. If they don't train regularly, they will jeopardise their chances of winning. Now school is over, will the team stay united to play their final tournament?"]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC One", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcone", "date_last_aired": "Thu 21 Feb 2019", "time_last_aired": "23:45"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": null}}

Using cutting-edge technology in this extended special we celebrate the highlights from the series. From the intense heat of the tropics to our planet's frozen poles, through to its unexplored depths, we reveal new worlds and extraordinary never-seen-before animal behaviours.", "Starting in the tropical coral reefs - the most diverse ocean habitat - a tusk fish demonstrates a surprising level of ingenuity - tool use - as it uses corals as an anvil to break open clams. In the Seychelles, half a million terns nest on an island. Fledglings must eventually take to the wing, but danger lurks beneath the waves: metre-long giant trevally fish leap clear out of the water to snatch birds on the wing.", "In the tropics sun heats the sea, creating rain, winds and huge storms that drive up towards higher latitudes. Here the seas change with the seasons. In spring thousands of mobula rays gather in Mexico's Sea of Cortez. At night, in a previously unseen event, tiny organisms that light up when disturbed react to their wingbeats, creating an enchanting bioluminescent firework display.", "The seasonal seas are home to bountiful kelp forests. In the undersea forests of southern Africa, one resident - the common octopus- has become the ultimate escape artist. To outwit her nemesis, the pyjama shark, she uses ingenious tactics, never filmed before. ", "On the coast, two worlds collide. Where sea meets land, coasts are the most dynamic and challenging habitats in the ocean. The ever-changing tides create rock pools. But these temporary worlds are a battleground. Predatory starfish turn a magical garden into the stuff of nightmares.", "The big blue is the world's greatest wilderness - it's a vast marine desert where there is little to eat and nowhere to hide. Sometimes there is a brief explosion of food in this marine desert, but ocean hunters must be fast to make the best of this bonanza. We witness super-pods of up to five thousand spinner dolphins racing to herd vast shoals of lanternfish, briefly caught at the surface where it is thought they spawn. New aerial footage reveals, for the first time, the spectacular feeding frenzy of 90kg tuna and dolphins smashing through the lantern fish shoals turning the sea white with foam.", "The deep is perhaps the most hostile environment on Earth, at least to us - a world of crushing pressure, brutal cold and utter darkness. We have barely begun to explore it and yet it is the largest living space on our blue planet, home to strange worlds like methane volcanoes and undersea lakes of salty brine. But life adapts in ingenious ways, like the sea toad - a fish that walks instead of swims. And barrel-eye - a deep sea fish with a translucent skull so that it can see through the top of its head to make the most of any glimmer of light.", "The deep is more closely connected to our own world than we ever thought possible due to giant ocean currents. We join these ocean currents as they begin their lives in Antarctica and flow from the poles to the tropics and back again, linking every ocean. Ocean currents move heat around our planet and maintain a climate favourable for life. But our ocean system, in relative equilibrium for millennia, is changing at a worrying rate.", "Deep in the polar north, we meet walrus mothers and their newborn calves, searching for an ice floe to rest on; but with rising temperatures, summer sea ice is retreating- their battles to survive are becoming ever harder. As we begin to understand the true complexity of the lives of our ocean creatures so do we recognise the fragility of their home."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC One", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcone", "date_last_aired": "Fri 4 Jan 2019", "time_last_aired": "19:00"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b09l2fgr": {"title": "Oceans of Wonder", "episode_no": null, "synopsis": "\nThis extended special journeys to new worlds and reveals new animal behaviours.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09l2fgr", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b09jbn5f": {"title": "Our Blue Planet", "episode_no": "Episode 7 of 10", "synopsis": "\n7/10 David Attenborough explores the issues behind the series' most spectacular stories.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09jbn5f", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b09hs07h": {"title": "Coasts", "episode_no": "Episode 6 of 10", "synopsis": "\n6/10 Coasts are the most changeable of the ocean worlds, but they offer great riches.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09hs07h", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b09gl670": {"title": "Green Seas", "episode_no": "Episode 5 of 10", "synopsis": "\n5/10 From enchanted forests to undersea prairies, the planet's green seas teem with life.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09gl670", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b09g5ks6": {"title": "Big Blue", "episode_no": "Episode 4 of 10", "synopsis": "\n4/10 This vast ocean desert where sperm whales must dive 1,000 metres just to feed.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09g5ks6", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b09g4d98": {"title": "Coral Reefs", "episode_no": "Episode 3 of 10", "synopsis": "\n3/10 The ingenious ways life exists in the undersea cities of tropical reefs.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09g4d98", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b09f8vtb": {"title": "The Deep", "episode_no": "Episode 2 of 10", "synopsis": "\n2/10 A groundbreaking journey to the deepest parts of the oceans.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09f8vtb", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "p04thmv7": {"title": "One Ocean", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 10", "synopsis": "\n1/10 New worlds and animal behaviours are uncovered on a journey from the equator to the poles.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p04thmv7", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {}}}}}

Piecing together the clues, Chris discovers to his horror that the girl's close-knit group of Orang Rimba was attacked not long after he met them, and a number of them killed. But was the girl among them?", "Chris travels into the heart of Sumatra and tries to discover the girl's fate by meeting the men who pulled the murdered tribespeople's bodies out of the river. On his way, he discovers just how much of Sumatra's once pristine rainforests have been replaced by palm oil plantations, palm oil whichis in around 50% of the products we buy in our supermarkets. Chris learns some uncomfortable truths about how we are all in some way connected to deforestation.", "As Chris's investigation reaches its dramatic conclusion, will he find the lost girl alive?

Art makes life worth living and is the great window into human potential. And societies become civilised to the extent that they take culture as seriously as the prosecution of power or the accumulation of wealth. But in the century of total war and industrial slaughter, was (and is) that enough? ", "The cause of humanity went up in the smoke of the Nazi crematoria. Horror and terror brushed beauty aside and stamped on its pretensions. In the modern world, art has become increasingly commodified. Simon's last programme explores the fate of art in the machine- and profit-driven world. It looks at the rise of art as a tradeable commodity and turns on one central question.

He travels into the jungle and comes face to face with the guerrilla army Farc, which is now promising to lay down arms. In the Pacific coast city of Buenaventura, Simon finds out more about the fearsome right-wing paramilitary gangs who now dominate the cocaine trade. As the Farc abandon the countryside, there is a fear that these groups will only grow in power. Travelling in the countryside, Simon meets the coca farmers who are demanding government support to stop growing coca and stop the flow of money to criminal gangs. With land ownership, poverty and drugs at the heart of Colombia's problems, it is in the countryside that the country's precarious future will be decided."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Sun 25 Nov 2018", "time_last_aired": "18:00"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": null}}

Inside every flat were the latest space-age gadgets - a lift, a shower and a fitted kitchen. But the dream turned sour. The Lincoln became notorious for drugs and violence. There was even a brutal murder. It was the same all over Britain - the flat was a byword for deprivation and social exclusion. But then, just as everything looked lost, the Lincoln was saved and with, perhaps, the hopes of an entire generation for that most precious of things - a home.

From the Vikings to the Tudors, Danny dresses, eats and lives his way through his family tree. And, remarkably, his journey is a retelling of 800 years of British history, which is all there in his bloodline.", "In this episode, Danny's first stop is Edward II and his French wife Isabella whose lives, to Danny's delight, play out like a medieval soap opera. As Danny romps through his family tree he dons 14th-century armour and learns to fight like his 19-times-great-grandfather, famous medieval knight Henry Hotspur Percy. To get closer to his Tudor ancestors Danny brushes up on his etiquette by learning to sing and dance just like one of Henry VIII's courtiers. And finally, Danny gets his hands on a ruff when his own family, in all their Tudor finery, join him at an Elizabethan sugar banquet."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Tomorrow", "time_last_aired": "01:15"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b0c1rr2w": {"title": "Episode 2", "episode_no": "Episode 2 of 2", "synopsis": "\n2/2 Danny dons 14th-century armour and learns to fight like his 19-times-great-grandfather.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c1rr2w", "time_left": "2 months left to watch (Mon 29 April 2019, 23:00)"}, "b0c0x03s": {"title": "Episode 1", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 2", "synopsis": "\n1/2 Danny Dyer delves into the lives of his royal forebears to find out how they lived.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c0x03s", "time_left": "2 months left to watch (Mon 29 April 2019, 23:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {"b0c1rr2w": {"program_title": "Episode 2", "series": "Series 1", "program_synopsis": "2/2 Danny dons 14th-century armour and learns to fight like his 19-times-great-grandfather.\n(R)", "program_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0c1rr2w", "channel": {"name": "BBC Two", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo"}, "broadcast": {"date": "12 Feb 2019", "day": "Tomorrow", "time": "01:15"}}}}}}}

Of course it was built as the tallest, but has now been pipped to the top spot by Saudi Arabia, another dictatorship. Other authoritarian regimes dominate the Big Five when it comes to flagpoles - countries like North Korea, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan. Could it be, wonders Ben, that while rich middle-aged men get a fast car as a midlife crisis-inspired penis enlargement, dictators go for giant flagpoles instead?", "Still wowed by the size of the pole, Ben goes to meet a man called Rustam, who was forcibly shaved by the police a couple of years ago. He finds out that the president of Tajikistan is worried about beards because he's terrified of Islamic radicalism. To find out more about how the government is keeping control of radical Islam, Ben heads to meet Aslideen, a youth activist who set up a movement that does the government's dirty work for it - keeping an eye on people out on the streets, reporting any suspicious behaviour to the police and generally terrorising the locals. Tajikistan is starting to feel like a police state in which independent thought is quickly stifled.", "On a mission to find some signs of dissent, Ben goes to meet a prominent young hip-hop artist. Around the world, hip-hop is a way for the youth to express their frustration; surely the rapper Baron will tell Ben what's wrong with this country? Instead, Ben finds Baron rapping about how great the president is, and he tells Ben that it would be stupid for him to rap about anything critical of the regime.", "It seems the population is so well trained that the government barely even needs to censor people. Though of course if it has to, it will, and it's more than happy to shut down any social media sites that become a problem. When a video of the president dancing embarrassingly at his son's wedding ended up doing the rounds online, the president did what any self-respecting dictator would do - he shut down YouTube in the country.", "As Ben is shown a beautiful but simple mountain village, surrounded by snow-capped peaks in the middle of nowhere, the secret police suddenly turn up.

After supporting his football team at an away game, he was set upon by a gang of men in a brutal and unprovoked attack. His wife Nicole rushed from her job as a senior care worker at a nursing home to find Simon fighting for his life in intensive care, after a massive stroke and bleed on the brain. Tragically, the vicious 90-second attack had left him permanently brain damaged, paralysed and unable to walk or talk, needing round-the-clock care. In July 2017, the 13 men were convicted for a 'ferocious attack'. Nine men were guilty of violent disorder, three of conspiracy to commit violent disorder and one of assisting an offender. After many months in hospital Simon is finally home, with Nicole as his full-time carer. He sleeps downstairs in a hospital bed in the living/dining room and is washed with a bowl of water as they can't access the upstairs bathroom. There is a make-shift curtain to separate the two spaces, but this doesn't stop the reality that he's lost his dignity, along with the life he once lived. Simon's current house is now unfit for purpose - it is inhibiting his rehabilitation and a massive strain on the family's life, and so that's where the DIY SOS volunteers step up and help this family in need. Interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen adds a truly unique and hilarious addition to the kitchen design, and the local RAF assist."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Tue 29 Jan 2019", "time_last_aired": "01:15"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b0c0bvxg": {"title": "The Big Build - Mildenhall", "episode_no": null, "synopsis": "\nNick Knowles and the team help a football fan whose life was changed when he was attacked.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c0bvxg", "time_left": "5 days left to watch (Sat 16 February 2019, 21:00)"}, "b04gnv7h": {"title": "The Big Build - Hereford", "episode_no": "Episode 4 of 7", "synopsis": "\n4/7 A couple adapt their home to meet the needs of their son with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b04gnv7h", "time_left": "11 days left to watch (Fri 22 February 2019, 21:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {}}}}}

The Mississippi's greatest surprise is its incredible reach. Its fingers stretch into nearly half of the USA, collecting water from 31 states. More than any other, this one river has helped unite the many and varied parts of America. The Mississippi's longest tributary begins life in the depths of winter, in the towering Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Montana. Billions of tonnes of water, ultimately destined to flow south are trapped as ice and snow. Here, its headwaters are a draw for the world's top ice climbers, who celebrate winter with daring climbs up towering frozen waterfalls - surely the most dangerous and spectacular winter faces of the ice-bound Mississippi.", "In this frozen wilderness, a handful of tenacious coyotes have learned to fish, in one remarkable Mississippi headwater kept flowing by the steaming geysers of Yellowstone National Park. In the bone-chilling water, the coyotes stand stock still for hours, risking severe hypothermia in the hope of pouncing on a fish. Spring in the Upper Mississippi in Minnesota, arrives on the wings of tens of thousands of white pelicans who bring the river to life. Both comical and beautiful, their crowded flotillas put on balletic, synchronised fishing displays. On the other side of the continent in crystal-clear Appalachian Mountain streams, some devious parents employ the creepiest childcare strategy on earth. Freshwater mussels produce bizarre growths which mimic small fish. These lifelike lures even have false eyes and dance, imitating real fish. Their purpose is to act as living bait, tricking larger predatory fish into attacking them. Once bitten, a cloud of blood-sucking baby mussels clamp onto the unwitting fish's gills. After several weeks of feeding on their victim's body fluids, they drop off and disperse. These sneaky mussels provide their babies with food and transport to different parts of the river. It is a macabre underwater puppet show, made all the more weird as the puppet master (the parent mussel) is blind and has no idea what a fish looks like.", "But the spring thaw also means extra work for busy beavers - safe in their cosy lodges all winter, they must now venture out to repair the damage that the rushing meltwater has done to their precious dams. As the river flows south through the central US, it becomes a vital transport link. Special cameras take us on a time-travelling journey down the busiest section of the river. A gigantic boat zooms hundreds of miles downriver in seconds, flashing through night and day. This is the industrial heart of the river. Even here, the river still hosts incredible wildlife spectacles. Each Independence Day, millions of mayflies gather in swarms so large they can be seen on weather radar.", "As it flows into the south, it spreads and slows, feeding the largest swamp in the US - the fertile, mysterious Atchafalaya. Over 2,000 square miles of wetlands, where alligators still rule. This is one of the richest and most diverse wilderness regions of the states, - a melting pot where racoons and beavers mix with tropical specialties like roseate spoonbills and emerald-green anole lizards. These back waters are the fabled spirit of the Mississippi made famous by Mark Twain and the Blues. As the massive river nears the ocean, it passes cities that have grown up along its banks - like New Orleans. Here 60 miles of docks make it the largest port in the western hemisphere where goods brought down the Mississippi are transferred to huge ocean going ships.", "At the end of its 3,500-mile journey, the Mississippi eventually creates one of the biggest river deltas on the planet. But today this delta is under threat. Damming and controls along the river's length are preventing the Mississippi's natural flood cycles - it can no longer replace land that the ocean washes away. This remarkable delta is home to millions of migrant birds and protects vast areas inland from hurricane surges. Its preservation is key to both the people and the wildlife here. The delta is a landscape built by the river from cornfields in Iowa, mountaisides in the Rockies and sediment from Tennessee streams - all collected and deposited by one huge river which unites and defines one great nation."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Wednesday", "time_last_aired": "01:15"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b0bwqpbj": {"title": "Mississippi", "episode_no": "Episode 3 of 3", "synopsis": "\n3/3 The surprising story of the Mississippi, a river that unites the USA.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bwqpbj", "time_left": "10 months left to watch (Thu 02 January 2020, 22:00)"}, "b0bwqng8": {"title": "Nile", "episode_no": "Episode 2 of 3", "synopsis": "\n2/3 A look at the astonishing wildlife, landscapes and people of the Nile.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bwqng8", "time_left": "10 months left to watch (Thu 02 January 2020, 22:00)"}, "b0bx73pk": {"title": "Amazon", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 3", "synopsis": "\n1/3 Revealing the animals, landscapes and people of the greatest river on Earth.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bx73pk", "time_left": "10 months left to watch (Thu 02 January 2020, 22:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {}}}}}

Survival for human beings can be an incredible challenge.", "The Natural Wonders are epic in scale: often rugged, possessing an awe-inspiring beauty. But the factors that create these stunning landscapes, can also present enormous challenges for the people who call them home. The extremes of nature encountered in many of Earth's natural wonders, can threaten human survival, or make human lives extraordinarily demanding. Yet human beings have devised remarkable ways to survive and even thrive in many of these places. Now these Natural Wonders are undergo all sorts of changes, and human survival techniques must also evolve", "In the high Himalaya, yak-herder Thokmay Lowa and his small group steer his herd through one of the region's extreme mountain passes. For several months of the year, these herders live isolated lives away from their families, before returning in spring to the summer pastures. Their journey is fraught with hazards, as the terrain they must cross is highly treacherous. With baby yaks being born later than usual this year, some are only a day old when they must tackle the pass.", "In the Canadian Arctic, traditional Inuit communities still forage for much of their food. 63-year-old Minnie Nappaaluk and her granddaughter Eva embark on one of the most hazardous expeditions for food - the mussel harvest. Winters here are so extreme the surface of the sea freezes, and when the spring tides go out, the sea ice is suspended above the seabed. Just as Inuit women have done for centuries, Minnie and Eva cut a hole through the sea ice and venture below this shifting, dangerous ice-layer to collect their bounty.", "Some Natural Wonders are threatened as never before - nowhere more so than the Brazilian Amazon. In the Mato Grosso, as a result of deforestation, the region's microclimate has changed. Now fires rage out of control in the dry season. Not only do these destroy wild habitats - they also threaten the very existence of the indigenous peoples still living traditional lives in the rainforest. Now, one project aims to tackle these blazes by teaching indigenous peoples how to effectively fight the fires. It's a daunting and dangerous task, but the continuance of their traditional way of life depends upon it.", "In the blistering Australian Outback, cattle ranching requires a lot of space. The only way to efficiently round up the herds on these vast farms is through the use of helicopter cowboys like Chris Weyand. It's a dangerous job - he must fly low and slowly over difficult terrain, and every year some pilots are killed. But thanks to the efforts of people like Chris, farming on this scale in the Outback is now possible.", "Deep in the Siberian interior, survival is tough. But climate change is opening up a new niche for the human inhabitants of this region - mammoth tusk collection. The tusks have been locked in the Siberian Permafrost for thousands of years, but as the climate changes and the permafrost starts to melt more each summer, it is giving up this unexpected bounty. These tusks are made of ivory, and can sell for thousands of dollars. It is a controversial activity - conservationists argue that it encourages the ivory trade. But for now at least this is a legal pursuit."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Yesterday", "time_last_aired": "16:00"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b09rbtsb": {"title": "Surviving the Extreme", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 3", "synopsis": "\n1/3 A look at amazing places on our planet and the people and creatures that inhabit them.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09rbtsb", "time_left": "29 days left to watch (Tue 12 March 2019, 17:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {"b09s8dkg": {"program_title": "Surviving with Animals", "series": "Series 2", "program_synopsis": "2/3 In many of the earth's natural wonders there is an abundance of animals.\n(R)", "program_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09s8dkg", "channel": {"name": "BBC Two", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo"}, "broadcast": {"date": "17 Feb 2019", "day": "Next Sunday", "time": "16:15"}}}}}}}

In the 1970s when Australia was in the midst of a deep recession, a rough and ready pub rock sound emerged, characterised by bands like Rose Tattoo who were promoted by family-run company Alberts. The raw power and fat guitar sound that characterised Aussie rock was pioneered by the Alberts and took Australia and the world by storm.", "The sound of Aussie rock really exploded when the Alberts, a well-to-do family from the Sydney suburbs, joined forces with the Youngs, a Glasgow family who had emigrated to Australia. The result was AC/DC.", "The documentary tells the story of how brothers Angus and Malcolm Young were produced by their older brother George and fellow Easybeats member Harry Vanda. Vanda and Young produced the band at Albert Studios and they were soon joined by the wild and charismatic lead singer Bon Scott.", "Head of Alberts was Ted Albert - a quietly confident risk-taker. He backed AC/DC for many years with rock-solid conviction when their type of music and fashion seemed completely at odds with a UK and US music scene dominated by punk. Then, in 1980, AC/DC's Back in Black album was a massive success around the world and the rest is history. The film retraces the band's explosion in popularity, the relentless touring and the tragic death of Bon Scott.", "Even after Bon's death, and with the addition of Brian Johnson, the band went from strength to strength and remain hugely popular and one of the world's most legendary bands. Today, the Albert family remains a potent force in Australian music."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Four", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour", "date_last_aired": "Sat 19 Jan 2019", "time_last_aired": "00:00"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": null}}

John's move pays off and he steams home full of prime langoustine and cod. John has been reflecting on the future of his son David, who is hoping to take over as skipper one day. So will John let David take the boat out on his own, and if so, does David think he's ready? On the Amity, skipper Phil Reid tries a new fishing ground to see if he can find a decent catch. But the hauls are disappointing and even a change in the weather conditions doesn't bring a change in fortune. Phil and the crew keep toiling away but return to Peterhead with 200 boxes of fish and just five prawns. On land, Phil has a tense wait at fishing's equivalent of the Oscars to find out if he's won an award for a new kind of net he has developed."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC One", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcone", "date_last_aired": "Last Monday", "time_last_aired": "19:30"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b0c1x0hd": {"title": "Episode 4", "episode_no": "Episode 4 of 6", "synopsis": "\n4/6 Phil Reid waits to find out if he has won an award for a new kind of net he has developed.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c1x0hd", "time_left": "23 days left to watch (Wed 06 March 2019, 20:00)"}, "b0c0h67x": {"title": "Episode 3", "episode_no": "Episode 3 of 6", "synopsis": "\n3/6 The fishing boat Zenith sets out from Fraserburgh in search of whitefish and prawns.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c0h67x", "time_left": "16 days left to watch (Wed 27 February 2019, 20:00)"}, "b0c01vrv": {"title": "Episode 2", "episode_no": "Episode 2 of 6", "synopsis": "\n2/6 The pair trawler Rosebloom gets a visit from a Norwegian coastguard boat.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c01vrv", "time_left": "9 days left to watch (Wed 20 February 2019, 20:00)"}, "b0c01v5v": {"title": "Episode 1", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 6", "synopsis": "\n1/6 The Reliance heads to a fishing ground off the Shetland Isles in search of whitefish.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c01v5v", "time_left": "2 days left to watch (Wed 13 February 2019, 20:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {"b0c2pb20": {"program_title": "Episode 5", "series": "Series 1", "program_synopsis": "5/6 Quality advisor Allison Sherrington makes her rounds at the fishmarket.", "program_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0c2pb20", "channel": {"name": "BBC One", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcone"}, "broadcast": {"date": "11 Feb 2019", "day": "Today", "time": "19:30"}}, "b0c3hbhv": {"program_title": "Episode 6", "series": "Series 1", "program_synopsis": "6/6 Allison awaits the environmental health inspectors' decision about the new fish market.", "program_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0c3hbhv", "channel": {"name": "BBC One", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcone"}, "broadcast": {"date": "20 Feb 2019", "day": "Wed 20 Feb 2019", "time": "19:30"}}}}}}}

To complete the 16-mile main section of the super sewer, four bespoke tunnelling machines have been designed and work is underway to prepare for their launch. ", "In Battersea, one of the strategically most important sites on the project, the team must assemble the \u00a315m tunnel boring machines on site.

Now the team has just three months to put together the 900-tonne jigsaws, before lowering them 60 metres into the ground, to begin tunnelling in earnest. ", "Ahead of the machines setting off, the opening section of the tunnel in Battersea has to be burrowed by excavators and reinforced with spray concrete lining to prevent it collapsing. The team are on a tight two-month schedule, but when their tunnellers hit the 52-million-year-old compressed rock of the Upper Shelley Beds, progress is in peril.

The Arctic has been warming at twice the global average, and David heads out with a Norwegian team to see what this means for polar bears. He comes face to face with a tranquilised female and discovers that mothers and cubs are going hungry as the sea ice on which they hunt disappears. In Canada, Inuit hunters have seen with their own eyes what scientists have seen from space - the Arctic Ocean has lost 30% of its summer ice cover over the last 30 years. For some, the melting sea ice will allow access to trillions of dollars' worth of oil, gas and minerals. For the rest of us, it means the planet will get warmer, as sea ice is important to reflect back the sun's energy. Next, David travels to see what is happening to the ice on land. In Greenland, he follows intrepid ice scientists as they study giant waterfalls of meltwater, which are accelerating iceberg-calving events and ultimately leading to a rise in global sea levels.", "Temperatures have also risen in the Antarctic - David returns to glaciers photographed by the Shackleton expedition and reveals a dramatic retreat over the past century. It is not just the ice that is changing - ice-loving adelie penguins are disappearing and more temperate gentoo penguins are moving in. Finally, we see the first ever images of the largest recent natural event on our planet - the break up of the Wilkins Ice Shelf, an ice sheet the size of Jamaica, which shattered into hundreds of icebergs in 2009."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Tue 23 Feb 2016", "time_last_aired": "16:15"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b00zj39j": {"title": "On Thin Ice", "episode_no": "Episode 7 of 7", "synopsis": "\n7/7 David Attenborough investigates the effects of rising temperatures in the polar regions.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00zj39j", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b00zj39x": {"title": "The Last Frontier", "episode_no": "Episode 6 of 7", "synopsis": "\n6/7 What draws humans to the coldest and most hostile reaches of our planet?\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00zj39x", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b00zj35r": {"title": "Winter", "episode_no": "Episode 5 of 7", "synopsis": "\n5/7 The story of the few extreme survivors who remain in the polar regions during winter.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00zj35r", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b00zj35p": {"title": "Autumn", "episode_no": "Episode 4 of 7", "synopsis": "\n4/7 Autumn brings epic journeys for polar wildlife as most hurry to escape the refreeze.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00zj35p", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b00zj35m": {"title": "Summer", "episode_no": "Episode 3 of 7", "synopsis": "\n3/7 Polar animals race to rear their young during times of plenty under the midnight sun.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00zj35m", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b00zj35k": {"title": "Spring", "episode_no": "Episode 2 of 7", "synopsis": "\n2/7 Spring arrives in the polar regions, and the sun appears after an absence of five months.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00zj35k", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}, "b00zj1q5": {"title": "To the Ends of the Earth", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 7", "synopsis": "\n1/7 Looking at the Arctic and Antarctic, the greatest and least-known wildernesses of all.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00zj1q5", "time_left": "1 month left to watch (Wed 03 April 2019, 09:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {}}}}}

Amazing technical advances have increased doctors' ability to treat a wide range of life-threatening diseases, meaning many more people live longer lives. Life expectancy has surged, and we regard death as something to be battled. It is common for the medical system to throw everything into treating patients right to the very end.", "But in our attempts to defeat death, the question is this - are we over-medicalising death and the final years of life at the expense of providing better palliative care that would result in a better quality of life?

Three kidney transplants are due to happen in one day. The Royal is home to one of 24 kidney transplant centres in the UK. Transplant surgery is classified as an emergency but there is only one emergency operating theatre at The Royal, shared by ten departments. If that theatre is overloaded then planned surgeries in other theatres will be cancelled to make way for transplants. Increasing rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes and an ageing population has meant the number of transplants at The Royal\u2019s renal unit has doubled in the 20 years it has been going.", "24 hours ago Pamela, who is in her mid-fifties, had no idea she would now be in the Royal waiting to go into theatre. A kidney matching Pamela\u2019s tissue type has just been donated. Two thirds of kidneys available for transplants are from people whose families agreed to support donation after they died. There is a 12-hour optimum window for a kidney transplant once it has been removed. Often organs travel more than five hours across the country so as the clock ticks, The Royal\u2019s transplant team and Pamela have to be ready. She has only been on the transplant waiting list for six months since a bladder problem damaged her kidneys. She had been told it would be two to three years. Her kidneys are now only functioning 5%.", "33-year-old Collette is a mum of two girls and a boy and also waiting to go into theatre. Her operation is planned. As a live donor, Collette is about to give one of her kidneys to her older brother, 38-year-old Michael, who has end stage kidney failure. He was diagnosed four years ago and has had to dialyse for four hours, four times a week for the last year. There is no cure. A transplant is his only chance.

Until there is space on the emergency theatre list, the brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s planned donor surgery will have to be postponed to make way for the new emergency.

It is the only hospital trust in the UK that specialises in caring for women and babies and looks after the region\u2019s most complex pregnancies. Lauren is 33 weeks pregnant with twin boys, Bobby and Albi. Bobby is perfectly healthy but early on it was discovered that his brother Albi had a fatal condition called anencephaly, where the top of his skull had not developed properly. Soon after birth Albi will die. Lauren and her fiance Gary want to donate Albi\u2019s heart valves to help children with cardiac conditions and his liver cells to help patients of any age with liver failure. When Lauren starts to feel increasing pain, her consultant obstetrician at The Women\u2019s brings forward her caesarean date but it may mean that Albi will be too young and too small to donate his heart valves and liver cells. The doctors have to balance this with the welfare of Lauren and the healthy baby boy, Bobby.", "There are more than 6,000 people on the transplant waiting list in the UK.

Over four centuries the potteries in Staffordshire have made everything from the everyday essentials found in British households, to the fine ceramics collected by royalty and connoisseurs across the globe.", "Presenter Steph McGovern leads the makers through the ages from the 17th century to the present day. She is guided by celebrity potter Keith Brymer Jones. First, they have to get the clay out of the ground. The Staffordshire area lay over rich clay seams and the makers get stuck into digging up the raw clay from a local field. It is a mucky job and Katie and Charlton work together to get rid of the grit and impurities. They are then tasked with making 17th-century butter pots, throwing them on a 'momentum wheel'. It is a rudimentary potter's wheel powered by kicking a heavy stone flywheel with their feet. Claire is a professional ceramic artist and Charlton studied ceramics at University, but Katie and Jason are complete beginners. The results aren't pretty. Even experienced potters Claire and Charlton struggle to get a high enough 'rise' on the sides of their butter pots. Back in the 1600s the butter pots would have been a consistent size, but despite their best attempts the makers end up with pots that are a variety of different shapes!", "This is a life-changing episode for ceramic artist Claire. It is her first time in Stoke and she finds out she is descended from a long line of celebrated Staffordshire potters: the Adams family. She learns from Steph that two Adams brothers were fined ten pence for digging potholes in a road in order to obtain local clay. Claire finds it very emotional that she has such a direct connection to Stoke.", "After spending a night sleeping on the factory floor, the makers wake up to a new era of pottery making in Staffordshire - the 1700s. They attempt to copy a beautiful oblong shaped tea cannister, decorated with blue cobalt pigment. This type of ceramic was part of a craze for Chinese-inspired ornaments and fashion known as chinoiserie. The makers use the slab-building technique of the time. They find it more methodical and precise than using a wheel.", "Next, the makers enter the era of mass production in the 1800s. This was also the era when bone china was invented in Staffordshire, a British alternative to porcelain that was cheaper and more practical. They marvel at the size of their new surroundings at Gladstone Pottery - a massive factory work yard surrounded by enormous bottle kilns. They are quickly put to work by Keith Brymer Jones. Katie is the 'jiggerer' - she has to use a fast-moving 'jiggering' machine to shape the clay into a plate. She needs to move quickly if she is going to produce anything like the thousands of plates per day made in the 1800s. Katie has a team to support her: Claire helps to prepare the clay into balls and Charlton bats them out into flat pancakes. It is a fast and fun production line. But the makers are shocked to learn that children would have carried out these support roles. Charlton and Jason also have a go at stacking a kiln with giant pots known as 'saggars' - vessels used for stacking up ceramics in the kilns. They are amazed by the speed and accuracy needed for this tough, backbreaking work.", "Back in the 21st century, the makers then visit the world famous pottery company, Wedgwood. Established in the 1700s, the iconic British brand is a household name in fine decorative ceramics. Ironically its main market is now China and Japan, who value its heritage most. The makers have a go at creating elaborately decorated 'Jasperware' goods. The makers learn that to mass produce a highly decorative product takes an extraordinary level of skill and expertise. These are skills that are still alive and well in Stoke today."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Thursday", "time_last_aired": "19:00"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b0bsrq28": {"title": "Pottery", "episode_no": null, "synopsis": "\nOur makers explore how Stoke-on-Trent became the world capital of ceramics.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bsrq28", "time_left": "26 days left to watch (Sat 09 March 2019, 20:00)"}, "b0bs2twg": {"title": "Hats", "episode_no": null, "synopsis": "\nThis episode looks at Luton's glamourous secret, hat-making.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bs2twg", "time_left": "25 days left to watch (Fri 08 March 2019, 20:00)"}, "b0bqn13y": {"title": "Chocolate", "episode_no": null, "synopsis": "\nThis delectable episode traces our love affair with chocolate back to York.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bqn13y", "time_left": "24 days left to watch (Thu 07 March 2019, 20:00)"}, "b0bpz4ks": {"title": "Steel", "episode_no": null, "synopsis": "\nThe makers experience Sheffield's transformation into an industrial powerhouse.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bpz4ks", "time_left": "23 days left to watch (Wed 06 March 2019, 20:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {"b0btxv46": {"program_title": "Cheese", "series": "Series 1", "program_synopsis": "Our makers arrive in Wensleydale, home of one of Britain's favourite cheeses.\n(R)", "program_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0btxv46", "channel": {"name": "BBC Two", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo"}, "broadcast": {"date": "11 Feb 2019", "day": "Today", "time": "19:00"}}, "b0bvg6r4": {"program_title": "Shoes", "series": "Series 1", "program_synopsis": "The makers discover how Northampton dominated the shoe industry for centuries.\n(R)", "program_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0bvg6r4", "channel": {"name": "BBC Two", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo"}, "broadcast": {"date": "12 Feb 2019", "day": "Tomorrow", "time": "19:00"}}}}}}}

Taking a ferry across the Strait of Gibraltar, Simon's first stop is Ceuta, a Spanish exclave surrounded by Morocco. This is one of the few land borders between Africa and the European Union. Simon joins the Spanish border police who check engines and even dashboards for stowaways trying to reach Europe. Migrant and refugees attempting to cross Ceuta's fortress border have quadrupled in the last year. Undaunted by Morocco's failure to issue a filming permit, Simon crosses the border as a tourist, tracking down a group of migrants hiding in a forest close to Ceuta. They have travelled thousands of miles, crossing the Sahara to get this far, and now they are just a 20-foot, razor wire fence away from their European dream.", "Crossing the Med to Spain, one the busiest shipping lanes in the world, Simon discovers huge numbers of dolphins and even giant whales surviving by dodging the ferries, container ships and oil tankers. Travelling along the southern Spanish coast, Simon takes to air to witness the plastic that forms over a hundred square miles of greenhouses. It is where much of our supermarket fruit and veg are grown, but as Simon discovers it is a massive industry built on the back of a low paid, migrant workforce. Simon travels to the Costa Blanca and the resort of Benidorm. Simon is surprised to learn that high-rise Benidorm is now being hailed as a model of sustainable tourism. The Mediterranean region attracts a third of world tourism and visitor numbers are predicted to rise to half a billion a year by the end of the next decade. Simon travels to a western corner of Corsica, a nature reserve that must be one of the most heavily protected bits of sea on earth, and one of the few places where tourists are actively discouraged from visiting. The park's manager shows Simon the results, taking him for a dive in the fishiest place in the Med. In a sea where over ninety percent of fish stocks are over exploited, it is a beacon of hope."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Wed 7 Nov 2018", "time_last_aired": "01:05"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b0bqn4g1": {"title": "Episode 4", "episode_no": "Episode 4 of 4", "synopsis": "\n4/4 Simon travels across the sea to Spain, and on to Corsica and the French Riviera.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bqn4g1", "time_left": "2 months left to watch (Fri 03 May 2019, 19:30)"}, "b0bpv51x": {"title": "Episode 3", "episode_no": "Episode 3 of 4", "synopsis": "\n3/4 Simon Reeve embarks on the third leg of his four-part journey around the Mediterranean.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bpv51x", "time_left": "2 months left to watch (Fri 03 May 2019, 20:00)"}, "b0bp2kk1": {"title": "Episode 2", "episode_no": "Episode 2 of 4", "synopsis": "\n2/4 Simon finds an island still deeply divided between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bp2kk1", "time_left": "2 months left to watch (Sat 27 April 2019, 21:00)"}, "b0bnb6vc": {"title": "Episode 1", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 4", "synopsis": "\n1/4 Simon Reeve embarks on the first leg of an extraordinary journey around the Mediterranean.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bnb6vc", "time_left": "2 months left to watch (Sat 27 April 2019, 21:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {}}}}}

Mim never saw or heard from his father again. He grew up surrounded by his mother's family, with barely a mention of his father. They have no idea where he is or whether he is alive or dead. Mim's mother has suffered from mental health problems all her life and it has been impossible for Mim to ask her about his father.", "In this film Mim embarks on a deeply personal journey, delving into his family history to discover the truth of what happened to his parents' marriage. His main quest is to find his dad and ask him why his mother had to leave all those years ago - and why he's never been in touch.", "Information on his father is almost non-existent. Mim starts his search with three photos of his dad taken in 1991 that he's never seen before. Speaking for the first time to close family members about his parents' marriage, he begins to build a picture of his father's character. As he delves deeper into his father's story, he discovers his dad is far older than he expected - he fears that he may have died and his search will be in vain.", "His search takes him to Dudley, which is where he was born and which is his dad's last known location. But every lead turns out to be a dead end, until he meets a group of his dad's old friends who break his case wide open. Mim sets out on an unforgettable global journey to finally get the answers he's been wanting for 26 years."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Wed 16 Jan 2019", "time_last_aired": "04:05"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": null}}

The single idea with the most investment potential is given a two-day trial to prove themselves worthy of the money they are seeking. However, only those investors with the most passion and interest in the idea will follow it to Manchester.", "Amongst those pitching are friends Abi Glencross, 27, and Sadhbh Moore, 28, looking for \u00a3300,000 for their vegetarian cafe-cum-barge, Sustainable Food Story. Abi is a professional stunt woman, grain farmer and scientist, and was the first person in the UK to grow meat in a lab. Sadhbh was raised on a eco-farm in Ireland where she grew and foraged much of the food she ate. They began their supper clubs in July 2017 and are now looking to open their first business, on a barge, with dishes like roasted beetroot, goats cheese, chard and thyme tart on heritage grain pastry.", "Also pitching are Liverpool-based friends Dan Cameron, 26, and Josh Lundon, 26, with their Nordic-inspired, hyper-seasonal concept Skaus. They are seeking \u00a3210,000. The idea for Nordic-inspired cuisine came from the links Liverpool has with Scandanavia, like the classic stew, Scouse, in a bread bowl \u2013 slow braised beef stew, pickled beets and brown butter. They started with a series of pop-up events in April 2017, and have since held a number of very successful residencies around the city. Now they want Skaus to go full-time in its own permanent site.", "Finally, plant-based heritage cooking from Indo-Persia and the eastern Mediterranean. Tanya Gohil, 31, is seeking \u00a31million for Devi\u2019s. The name \u2018Devi\u2019 comes from the Indian word for goddess, as Tanya dedicates her concept to the women in her family who she calls \u201cthe queens of the kitchen\u201d. Devi\u2019s has operated a sell-out weekend stall at Maltby Street Market since January 2015 and various pop-up restaurants across London, as well as hosting Devi's Dining supper clubs in Hackney, with dishes like peshawari cauliflower qorma, sultanas, fried shallot, coconut, and preserved lemon grains. Now she is after \u00a31million to open permanently in central London.", "Each of the three ideas pitches to a panel of four investors, all keen to back the next hit sustainable restaurant idea on the high street. Darrel Connell is a partner at Imbiba - an investment firm specialising in investing in high growth leisure and hospitality businesses. Typically, Imbiba invests between \u00a31m to \u00a310m over a period of 5 years, in bars and restaurants that can grow to multiple sites. To date, they have invested over \u00a360m across more than 100 businesses throughout the UK.

", "Finally, they open for a full-priced lunch service, during which the investors must consider whether to invest or not. As the investors are in competition with each other, Fred will set them a deadline by which time they have to return to the restaurant if they intend to invest.

In fact they are our distant ancestors. About 2% of the DNA of most people is of Neanderthal origin - and it continues to affect us today.", "In this episode, Ella Al-Shamahi explores the fate of the Neanderthals - asking why they became extinct, and discovering how they live on inside of us today. The programme starts in the caves of Gibraltar, which may have been the last place the Neanderthals survived. Discoveries here have shown the Neanderthals lived a good life - feasting on seafood and wild game. These were a people who were supremely well adapted to their environment. But about 40,000 years ago they disappeared. Why? It wasn't because they were socially unsophisticated. Back in the studio we return to Ned - the scientific recreation of a Neanderthal we built in the first programme with the help of actor Andy Serkis and a team of scientific experts. In this episode, Andy helps us see Ned towards the end of his life. Ned's fossil shows that he had survived for many years after suffering a number of crippling injuries. This could only have happened if he had been cared for by the rest of his community. This was an advanced society that knew how to survive. So why did they disappear?", "One of the reasons might have been that they lost out in a physical showdown with modern humans. Ella investigates one of the world's oldest murder mysteries. A Neanderthal skeleton found in the Shanidar cave in Iraq gives us clues to a gruesome death. In the studio Ella and her team of scientists reconstruct an experiment to discover whether the perpetrator of this murder was a Neanderthal or a modern human. There are other reasons why Neanderthals may have become extinct: their small population size, or climate change. But when their DNA was first decoded in 2010 it became clear that they hadn't completely disappeared - because they live on inside of us - everyone except people from sub-Saharan Africa. Ella meets scientists who reveal how our genetic legacy from Neanderthals may have made all the difference to our survival in Ice Age Europe and how today the DNA from our ancestors affects our skin, our immune system, our risk for cancer, and even certain neuro-psychiatric diseases such as addiction.", "At the Pasteur Institute in Paris, Ella meets a scientist who explains how, once we know exactly what we have inherited from Neanderthals, we can use this information to develop new approaches to treating diseases such as the 'flu virus. But not all of our Neanderthal inheritance is necessarily good for us - it is possible that obesity and type 2 diabetes may have their roots in Neanderthal heritage. Finally, Ella explores a truly mind-blowing possibility that we could manipulate their DNA to bring a Neanderthal back to life. Individually many of us have around 2% Neanderthal DNA. But each person's 2% is different. It turns out that modern humans living today collectively have up to 70% of the Neanderthal genome walking around within us. It's enough that scientists have started contemplating bringing Neanderthals back from extinction."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Friday", "time_last_aired": "00:15"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b0b4dffq": {"title": "Episode 2", "episode_no": "Episode 2 of 2", "synopsis": "\n2/2 Ella Al-Shamahi explores the fate of the Neanderthals.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0b4dffq", "time_left": "26 days left to watch (Sun 10 March 2019, 01:15)"}, "b0b3gdg2": {"title": "Episode 1", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 2", "synopsis": "\n1/2 Andy Serkis and Ella Al-Shamahi investigate what Neanderthals looked like.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0b3gdg2", "time_left": "26 days left to watch (Sun 10 March 2019, 00:15)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {}}}}}

", "In this episode presenter Suzy Klein is joined by music lover and BBC world affairs editor John Simpson to explore how classical music underscored the coronations of George VI and Elizabeth II, how it provided succour and inspiration during WWII and how it responded to social change as we emerged into peace. They explain how William Walton, creator of the radical, witty piece Facade with Edith Sitwell in the 1920s, composed Crown Imperial for George VI\u2019s coronation, full of Elgarian pomp and circumstance. With the outbreak of war, Suzy investigates the remarkable legacy of pianist Myra Hess, her signature tune, Bach\u2019s Jesu Joy of Man\u2019s Desiring, and how Kenneth Clark encouraged her to create a series of morale-boosting lunchtime concerts at the National Gallery in the heart of war-torn London. An audience member remembers the moving and inspiring impact of Myra\u2019s music on those enduring the Blitz. From the tragic destruction of Queen\u2019s Hall, traditional home to the Proms, the episode charts the triumph of the first Prom in its new home, the Royal Albert Hall. John talks about the remarkable reception that greeted one of the pieces played at the prom, the first performance of Shostakovich\u2019s 7th Symphony, the Leningrad. Written under siege, the piece only arrived in Britain after the score was elaborately smuggled on film out of Russia via Iran to London. Paul Patrick, the BBC Philharmonic\u2019s principal percussionist, tells how he prepares for the demanding task of recreating the sound of war in the symphony. ", "The war over, our presenters chart the emergence of our love of classical music in peacetime, with the unexpected success of young composer Benjamin Britten\u2019s complex opera Peter Grimes and its hugely popular performance at Sadler's Wells. Tenor Stuart Skelton performs excerpts and reflects on why it struck such a chord. A new Labour government believed music should be part of everyone\u2019s experience and the 1944 Butler Education Act helped put music on the school curriculum for the very first time. Our presenters explore the creation of Britten\u2019s classic The Young Person\u2019s Guide to the Orchestra in 1945, and Malcolm Sargent\u2019s film of it, unforgettably introducing classical music to generations of children. Through the Festival of Britain, which brought music to the heart of the nation, this episode arrives at the 1953 Coronation. By then two and a half million homes had TVs and, with an audience of 20 million, the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II became a showcase of our best classical music for its biggest audience ever: Elgar, Holst, Vaughn Williams, Purcell, Handel\u2019s Zadok the Priest, and the whole event crowned by William Walton\u2019s Orb and Sceptre, a fresh youthful-sounding coronation march for a young queen. ", "Between the coronations of Elizabeth II and her father, the nation had undergone immense trauma, social and political change. This programme charts the role classical music played in sustaining our cultural life and responding to the challenges of a new era."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Four", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour", "date_last_aired": "Friday", "time_last_aired": "02:30"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": null}}

When an Elizabethan literary critic said that the witty soul of Ovid lived on in 'honey tongued Shakespeare', they were just stating the obvious. Ovid, everyone knew, was simply the most clever, sexy and funny poet in the western tradition. His Metamorphoses, it has often been said, is the most influential secular book in European literature.", "Unique among ancient poets, Ovid left us an autobiography, full of riveting intimacy, as well as ironical and slippery self-justification. Using Ovid's own words, brought to life by one of Britain's leading actors, Simon Russell Beale, the film tells the story of the poet's fame, and his fateful falling out with the most powerful man in the world, the Roman emperor Augustus.", "Born in Sulmona in central Italy, Ovid moved to Rome to study law but, seduced by 'the muse of poetry', he soon abandoned that career path. Part of Rome's postwar, young generation, Ovid rose to spectacular fame with his poems about sex - Love Affairs (Amores) and The Art of Love (Ars Amatoria) - an amoral guide to seduction and adultery. Today some of his poems are seen as problematic and even carry a health warning when studied in US universities. But he is difficult to pigeonhole as he also took the female side in a powerful series of fictional letters by women heroes.", "By his twenties he was a literary superstar and a thorn in the emperor's side, his poetry of sex and seduction falling foul of the emperor's new puritanism, which had even outlawed adultery. In the midst of a sensational sex scandal involving his daughter, the Emperor Augustus banished Ovid to the farthest edge of the empire - the wilds of the Black Sea coast and the marshes of the Danube delta. It's a tale full of sex, drama and scandal, but his banishment is still a mystery- as he put it, 'my downfall was all because of a poem - and a mistake- and on the latter my lips are sealed forever'.", "Exile in Romania was unbelievably harsh and dangerous, but worse for Ovid was a sense of separation and loss. His poetry from the Black Sea has inspired the European literature of exile for millennia, from Dante and Petrarch to Mandelstam and Seamus Heaney. The poems, the mystery, and Ovid's immense legacy in world literature and art, are discussed with leading experts, who trace his influence on, among others, Titian, Turner and even Bob Dylan, whose Modern Times album quarries Ovid's exile poetry. His greatest and most influential work Metamorphoses, a compendium of the great tales of Greek myth, became one of the core texts of Western culture. Artistic director of the RSC, Greg Doran looks at Ovid's influence on Shakespeare and the myths in the Metamorphoses that pervade our art, music, and literature. Professor Alessandro Schiesaro discusses Ovid and the postmodern imagination; Professor Roy Gibson untangles his relations with Augustus; while Dr Jennifer Ingleheart, author of a new study on Roman sexual politics, looks at Ovid's ambition, psychology and influence. Lisa Dwan -the leading interpreter of the drama of Samuel Beckett, another exile and Ovid fan, explores the poet's use of the female voice and his poetry of exile, which has influenced western writers and artists for the last two millennia.", "Following in Ovid's footsteps, Michael Wood travels from the poet's birthplace in the beautiful town of Sulmona, to the bright lights of the capital, Rome. Here we visit the Houses of Augustus and Livia, recently opened after 25 years of excavation and conservation. Inside the emperor's private rooms glow with the colour of their newly restored frescoes. Wood then follows Ovid into exile in Constanta in today's Romania, and on to the Danube delta, where dramatic footage shows the Danube and the Black Sea frozen over in winter just as Ovid described in his letters.", "Throughout the film Ovid's own words reveal an engaging personality: a voice of startling modernity. 'He is funny, irreverent, focused on pleasure and obsessed with sex' says Prof Roy Gibson. But, says Greg Doran, he is also a poet of cruelty and violence, which especially fascinated Shakespeare. Ovid raises very modern questions about the fluidity of identity and gender, and the mutability of nature. He also explores the relationship between writers and power and the experience of exile, themes especially relevant in our time when, as Lisa Dwan observes, exile has become part of the human condition. But above all, says Michael Wood, Ovid is the Poet of Love, and 2,000 years after his death he is back in focus as one of the world's greatest poets: ironical, profound, and relevant."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Four", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour", "date_last_aired": "Last Sunday", "time_last_aired": "22:30"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": null}}

From California to small-town Arizona, the royal couple promote Britain by day and party by night. They attend a dinner with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in a world where Hollywood royalty increasingly competes with the real thing. In Britain, the press starts to ask if the extravagant royal tour is a good way to spend public money. The mystique of monarchy is being increasingly undermined by the emergence of a more open and egalitarian society.", "In the years that follow, Anthony Armstrong-Jones begins to withdraw from royal duties and the couple lead increasingly separate lives. Press speculation about the state of their marriage intensifies. In the 1970s Margaret retreats more and more to the Caribbean island of Mustique in an attempt to secure a private life. In an era of celebrity gossip and the telephoto lens, her relationship with a younger man and beach parties with rock stars like Mick Jagger lead to ever more press interest. As Britain lurches from one economic crisis to the next, Margaret's Caribbean lifestyle becomes the lightning rod for republican attacks on the monarchy.", "In 1978, Margaret reflects changing attitudes sweeping the country and gets a divorce. The rebel royal is now increasingly eclipsed by a new generation of princesses. But in her own way, Princess Margaret helped pave the way for them and for the monarchy of the 21st century.", "Contributors include Lady Anne Glenconner, a childhood friend who became her lady-in-waiting, Jane Stevens, one of her closest friends, Basil Charles, the owner of a bar on the Caribbean island of Mustique, David Griffin, Princess Margaret's chauffeur, and Craig Brown, her unofficial biographer."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Sat 6 Oct 2018", "time_last_aired": "00:30"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b0bkz5wv": {"title": "Castaway", "episode_no": "Episode 2 of 2", "synopsis": "\n2/2 Following Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong-Jones at the start of their married life\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bkz5wv", "time_left": "5 weeks left to watch (Mon 18 March 2019, 21:00)"}, "b0bk8xcp": {"title": "Pleasure vs Duty", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 2", "synopsis": "\n1/2 How Princess Margaret combined the rebellious force of modernity and respect for tradition\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bk8xcp", "time_left": "5 weeks left to watch (Mon 18 March 2019, 21:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {}}}}}

Police arrested a man the girls liked and trusted - 20-year-old Russell Bishop - and in 1987 he was put on trial. But the jury took less than two hours to acquit him of the murders. Under the law at the time, Bishop could not be retried even if new evidence were to be found. The families of the murdered girls had to endure years of agony, without any prospect of justice for their lost children. Until 2005, when the double jeopardy law was abolished, rekindling the hopes of the families.", "Now police and scientists are using cutting-edge methods to uncover new evidence, which they hope will be enough for the CPS to pursue a fresh prosecution.

Then it is on to a true architectural and civic wonder - the vast Testaccio Slaughterhouse, where workers were once paid in offal which they took home and used as the basis of delicious dishes that are still sold in Rome today. Giorgio takes Andrew to his favourite Trippa stall to sample some of the best.

The war destroyed all trace of the life the sisters had known, but when Olga and Tatiana volunteered as Red Cross nurses they did enjoy a brief taste of the real world beyond the palace gates. The sisters became very close to some of the dashing young officers they nursed and Olga's touching diary entries reveal how she fell passionately in love with one particular Georgian officer, Dmitri Shakh-Bagov.

After five months under house arrest at the Alexander Palace the girls, along with the rest of their family, were sent into exile in Siberia. The sisters' letters from Siberia bring the boredom, frustration and uncertainty of their captivity powerfully to life. For much of their tragically short lives the girls had been as much prisoners as princesses and in their final weeks in exile in Siberia that imprisonment was absolute - the whitewashed windows of the house where they were held denied them even a glimpse of the outside world."]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Four", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour", "date_last_aired": "Mon 21 Jan 2019", "time_last_aired": "22:00"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"b04g6rhb": {"title": "The World Turned Upside Down", "episode_no": "Episode 2 of 2", "synopsis": "\n2/2 The last four years of the sisters' lives saw war, revolution, imprisonment and murder.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b04g6rhb", "time_left": "9 days left to watch (Wed 20 February 2019, 23:00)"}, "b04fljyk": {"title": "The Gilded Cage", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 2", "synopsis": "\n1/2 The childhood of Tsar Nicholas II's four daughters and their relationship with Rasputin.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b04fljyk", "time_left": "2 days left to watch (Wed 13 February 2019, 23:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {}}}}}

Now Tom wants them to use what they've learnt to be even more ambitious. He is challenging them to make bigger dishes for more people than ever before - to show how delicious food has the power to bring people together. Back in his kitchen, Tom makes a sumptuous chicken, ham and leek Pie - perfect for a large group to share, hot or cold. This is exactly the sort of dish that can transform how Tom's gang cook for their friends and family. ", "To mark the end of the experiment and celebrate their achievements, all the families are getting together for a picnic in a few days' time. Tom has asked them all to cook a dish they can bring along and share with the group. And Tom's not going to arrive empty handed either; he's doing his own version of Eton mess, a summer pudding that both kids and adults love. Meringues from scratch and a simple strawberry coulis are things all of us can make - other than that there's not much 'cooking'. This is a dish with lots of separate elements that taste incredible when combined and it's ideal for a summer party.", "Meanwhile Tom asks each family to come up with a resolution to take forward now that the experiment is coming to an end; a pledge that's personal to their own experience and will help keep their cooking and eating on track in the months and years ahead. He also asks the gang to take the same set of health and fitness tests as they did at the start, to find out how much progress they've made.", "The final day of the experiment comes around and all the Fresh Start gang gather together for a picnic and cricket match.

But theirs is no ordinary lab because inside it is crammed with 30 pairs of identical twins! Thanks to their matching DNA, identical twins are the perfect candidates for scientific comparison. Chris and Xand use this principle in The Twinstitute to put contrasting health theories to the test. Pairs of twins are split into two groups and each challenged to carry out a task. The results \u2013 from diet tips to health tricks reveal ways we could all make lifestyle improvements. This is 'New Year, new you' tested scientifically.", "In this episode, two pairs of identical twins are finding out the best way to learn a language - putting the two most popular styles of learning head to head in self-taught versus taught. With 65% of us saying we would like to be able to speak another language, this test will determine the best way to go about it for you!", "Chris has arranged for Des and Tina go back to school to learn a language from scratch. With 30 hours of scheduled lessons over four weeks with a language teacher, they are going to have to make space in their busy schedules for this real-time contact. The pros to this process? Des and Tina are safe in the knowledge that the guidance they are receiving is pre-planned, and they get real time feedback on their pronunciation and progress, but is it all a bit old fashioned?", "To find out, Xand has set Nick and Lia loose to see if self-teaching is now advanced enough to take on the teachers. In addition to phrase books, there is now an abundance of options available for the budding linguist, via smart phones, online videos and internet radio. Apps now offer the flexibility to learn whenever and wherever they choose and with millions of us now using them every day, we find out if they can really hold their own against the tried and tested method of face-to face communication. But without a teacher it will take dedication and self-discipline for our twins - is this just too much to achieve alone?", "Next is a story that sees Chris and Xand put their identical twin bodies on the line in a quest to look younger. A recent survey suggested that the average woman in Britain spends \u00a31,300 a year trying to reduce the effects of ageing, But in an industry cursed with bad science and outlandish claims, is there a technique that could work? Chris and Xand opt to put two techniques head to head that come from opposite ends of the spectrum. Xand is going to spend a month doing an hour of facial yoga every single day for a month. Although the science of facial yoga is in its infancy, it is touted as being the next big thing. By exercising the face you increase the blood flow to the skin which may be beneficial. In addition, with exercise, comes muscle tone which can lead to a plumper, fuller, more youthful face. And hey, it is free!", "Meanwhile Chris is going high-end. He will have a single, one-off but expensive treatment: a vampire facial. Popular with the Kardashians, this extreme makeover is also touted as being effective by some people but to say it is an unusual treatment would be an understatement. At an exclusive Harley Street clinic, Chris first has some of his blood drawn. That blood is then spun at high speeds to separate it out into its constituent parts, before the serum is injected back into his face! The theory is that the serum contains \u201cgrowth factors\u201d released when the blood was spun at speed. Those growth factors supposedly then cause his skin to regenerate courtesy of the trauma caused by the injections. ", "But will either work? To find out the guys have their skin age assessed by a special camera system which will pull no punches in scrutinising every pore! ", "Finally this week is a story that involves secret science \u2013 a story that we can\u2019t tell our twins about for fear of influencing the result. Can the brightness of a room can affect your appetite? Intriguing new research suggests that we unknowingly eat more when a room is brightly lit and there is good science to support this: in bright light, the brain is super-stimulated and put into a state known as arousal and, according to some, when aroused, we get more greedy. In dim light, the brain is much calmer and with that calmness our greed level drops off. But will that theory stack up in practice? To find out our twins are split into two lunch groups. The first set has their buffet under bright light and the other has the same buffet under dim light. By precisely measuring the amount of food consumed, Chris and Xand are able to work out exactly how many calories each team of twins ate. And the results are simply staggering!", "Using the latest science, and bringing a visual flair to health programming, The Twinstitute aims to reveal tips and tricks that can help us all live a healthier life!"]}, "broadcast_info": {"channel_text": "BBC Two", "channel_link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo", "date_last_aired": "Wednesday", "time_last_aired": "20:30"}, "recommendations": null, "available_episodes": {"episodes": {"available_episodes": {"m0002fms": {"title": "Learn a Language", "episode_no": "Episode 6 of 6", "synopsis": "\n6/6 Twins test the best way to learn a new language and attempt to look younger.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0002fms", "time_left": "25 days left to watch (Fri 08 March 2019, 21:00)"}, "b0c1svl0": {"title": "Giving Up Smoking", "episode_no": "Episode 5 of 6", "synopsis": "\n5/6 Twins kick a habit, discover if hand-washing keeps you healthy and test their focus.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c1svl0", "time_left": "25 days left to watch (Fri 08 March 2019, 21:00)"}, "b0c13hfk": {"title": "Better Brain", "episode_no": "Episode 4 of 6", "synopsis": "\n4/6 Twins find out if its possible to get a better brain and get fit by watching TV!\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c13hfk", "time_left": "25 days left to watch (Fri 08 March 2019, 21:00)"}, "b0c06jww": {"title": "HIIT versus Easy", "episode_no": "Episode 3 of 6", "synopsis": "\n3/6 Identical twins help find out the best way to get fit and beat nausea.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0c06jww", "time_left": "25 days left to watch (Fri 08 March 2019, 21:00)"}, "b0by3f5p": {"title": "Sleep Deprivation", "episode_no": "Episode 2 of 6", "synopsis": "\n2/6 Twins test the best way to beat fatigue and discover the effect of smartphones on IQ.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0by3f5p", "time_left": "25 days left to watch (Fri 08 March 2019, 22:30)"}, "b0bx0gjv": {"title": "Get Thin Fast", "episode_no": "Episode 1 of 6", "synopsis": "\n1/6 Twins test the best way to lose weight, improve memory and beat pain without pills.\n", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0bx0gjv", "time_left": "25 days left to watch (Fri 08 March 2019, 21:00)"}}, "upcoming_episodes": {}}}}}

One of the greatest British choral works of the 20th Century, War Requiem is seen by many as a true masterpiece. ", "The ENO are the first company to transform the work into a dramatised performance. Artistic Director Daniel Kramer engaged a team drawn from across the world including the Turner Prize-winning artist Wolfgang Tillmans: \u2018By keeping War Requiem alive and relevant today, we will be able to remember the sense of urgency that people in the post war generation felt, a sense of never again.\u2019", "For Britten, writing a piece for the re-consecration of Coventry Cathedral was the opportunity he had been waiting for. The original building was destroyed during World War II. He wanted to create a powerful statement against the horrors of war, a piece that inspired reconciliation. The result was an emotionally charged piece that requires three soloists, a large choir, a children\u2019s choir, a large orchestra, two organs as well as a chamber orchestra. Juxtaposing the traditional Latin Requiem Mass with the World War I poet Wilfred Owen\u2019s powerful anti-war poetry, the overall effect is a powerful emotional journey. ", "The destruction of war is no less a significant theme now than when War Requiem was first performed. Daniel Kramer\u2019s ambition in creating a staged version of the music was fostered by a belief that he could amplify Britten\u2019s original intentions. ", "The film begins where the music itself was born \u2013 in Coventry. Wolfgang and Daniel explore the ruins of the old Coventry Cathedral before moving into the vast echoing space of the new cathedral. It is a visit that becomes a critical moment in shaping their creative approach to staging the piece.", "The programme follows over twelve months the development of Tillmans\u2019s vision around three eight-metre-high LED screens forming the backdrop to the stage. He engages British fashion designer Nasir Mazhar to craft the 123 costumes and, as the vision grows, the cast grows. It is not long before the whole English National Opera family has joined this momentous journey. We witness the design discussions, costume-making and set builds, sculpture-making, movement rehearsals and snow tests, and last, but definitely not least, the orchestra rehearsals. ", "Working alongside the design team is celebrated conductor and ENO Music Director, Martyn Brabbins. His role could be seen as the guardian of the music. \u2018It really is a masterpiece. My job as a conductor is to serve the composer. My whole life has been spent understanding what composers mean and how they want their music to be presented.\u2019", "As the production edges nearer the Coliseum\u2019s stage, the cast widens to include three soloists, a chorus of 80 men and women, and a 40-strong children\u2019s choir. ", "Revered baritone Roddy Williams, tenor David Butt Philips and soprano Emma Bell lead the singers in this unique journey. They reveal what War Requiem means to them, how the process they have been involved in has affected their understanding of the piece, and their thoughts about war and violence today. Preparing for his solo in the Dies Irae, Roddy tells us, \u2018In that moment I understood with great clarity what it is like to have the power in the room because you are holding a weapon.\u2019", "Just one week before they share their work with the world, the ENO\u2019s War Requiem moves to the London Coliseum. Once on stage, all the elements must come together and work seamlessly including the eight-metre high LED screens, a vast wasteland sculpture on wheels, not to mention the 123 \u2018bodies of war\u2019. Daniel, Wolfgang and Martyn all look on as the vision starts to become a reality for the very first time.

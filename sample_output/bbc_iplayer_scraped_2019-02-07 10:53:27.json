Diagnosed with speech dyspraxia at an early age, it's affected his speech - but he's also an outgoing child with an interest in music and acting. When we find him at Mary Hare boarding school for deaf children, he's now focusing his efforts on dance - and has a strong network of deaf friends.",
        "Yasin was also born to hearing parents, but has been in mainstream education all of his life, with very little interaction with other deaf children. He continues to work hard academically and has big dreams of working in the sciences. We caught up with him at a football tournament in the Midlands.",
        "Lucy was born to deaf parents and has three deaf siblings. Her family all sign - and Lucy started out at a deaf school but has gradually transitioned to being educated in a mainstream school with communication support. She continues to swim several days a week, and dreams of competing in the 2021 Deaflympics."

        "In this film, Dr Kevin Fong makes a personal journey through the moral questions about death that face not just the medical profession, but each and every one of us. The question of how we die is a question that all of us must face, and yet we avoid talking about it. Modern medicine is focused on saving lives. Amazing technical advances have increased doctors' ability to treat a wide range of life-threatening diseases, meaning many more people live longer lives. Life expectancy has surged, and we regard death as something to be battled. It is common for the medical system to throw everything into treating patients right to the very end.",
        "But in our attempts to defeat death, the question is this - are we over-medicalising death and the final years of life at the expense of providing better palliative care that would result in a better quality of life? Is it time to reset the system, and learn how to die a better death? Kevin meets medical professionals who are at the heart of these dilemmas, as well as people who are right now facing up to the question of how to die a better death."

        "Adventurer and journalist Simon Reeve heads to Vietnam to uncover the stories behind the nation's morning pick-me-up. While we drink millions of cups of the stuff each week, how many of us know where our coffee actually comes from? The surprising answer is that it is not Brazil, Colombia or Jamaica, but Vietnam. Eighty per cent of the coffee we drink in Britain isn't posh cappuccinos or lattes but instant coffee, and Vietnam is the biggest supplier. ",
        "From Hanoi in the north, Simon follows the coffee trail into the remote central highlands, where he meets the people who grow, pick and pack our coffee. Millions of small-scale famers, each working two or three acres, produce most of the coffee beans that go into well-known instant coffee brands.",
        "Thirty years ago Vietnam only produced a tiny proportion of the world's coffee, but after the end of the Vietnam war there was a widescale plan to become a coffee-growing nation, and Vietnam is now the second biggest in the world. The coffee industry has provided employment for millions, making some people very rich indeed, and Simon meets Vietnam's biggest coffee billionaire. But he also learns that their rapid success has come at a cost to both the local people and the environment."

        "On 1 January 2019, Nasa's New Horizons probe notched up another historic first: the first ever Kuiper belt fly-by. Its target was 2014 MU69, a chunk of ice and rock about four billion miles (approximately 6.4 billion kilometres) from Earth, dubbed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase meaning a distant, unknown region. It is the most distant fly-by in history, and it is believed the data New Horizons gathers will shed new light on the solar system's early days. Chris Lintott reports from the John Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland to bring the latest news and pictures from this extraordinary mission."

        "David Attenborough narrates the final episode in the documentary series that shows our planet in all its glory. In this part, he looks at the largest of all habitats - the ocean. From the surface to the distant abyss, it encompasses 90 per cent of all the living space on our planet. Its depths plunge to over 11 kilometres down and it hides over 30,000 immense volcanic mountains, some far taller than Mount Everest. Much of this vastness is a virtual desert, but the creatures that do live here include the most bizarre, most powerful and most charismatic of all. It is the home of the greatest animal ever to have existed, the blue whale, twice the size of the largest known dinosaurs. ",
        "So, from the sinister 'vampire squid from hell' glowering in the depths, to the scintillating attacks of 100 sabre-billed sailfish speeding at the surface, explore the alien world of the open ocean in the safety of your living room."

        "Nick Knowles and the DIY SOS volunteers help Simon Dobbin in Mildenhall, Suffolk - a loving father, husband and football fan whose life suddenly changed forever in March 2015. After supporting his football team at an away game, he was set upon by a gang of men in a brutal and unprovoked attack. His wife Nicole rushed from her job as a senior care worker at a nursing home to find Simon fighting for his life in intensive care, after a massive stroke and bleed on the brain. Tragically, the vicious 90-second attack had left him permanently brain damaged, paralysed and unable to walk or talk, needing round-the-clock care. In July 2017, the 13 men were convicted for a 'ferocious attack'. Nine men were guilty of violent disorder, three of conspiracy to commit violent disorder and one of assisting an offender. After many months in hospital Simon is finally home, with Nicole as his full-time carer. He sleeps downstairs in a hospital bed in the living/dining room and is washed with a bowl of water as they can't access the upstairs bathroom. There is a make-shift curtain to separate the two spaces, but this doesn't stop the reality that he's lost his dignity, along with the life he once lived. Simon's current house is now unfit for purpose - it is inhibiting his rehabilitation and a massive strain on the family's life, and so that's where the DIY SOS volunteers step up and help this family in need. Interior designer Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen adds a truly unique and hilarious addition to the kitchen design, and the local RAF assist."

        "Isa's pulse is set racing as a long-lost companion returns to Craiglang from Hollywood. As Isa and Callum get reacquainted, she has to fend off stiff competition, especially from one particularly persistent gooseberry.",
        "Meanwhile, Boabby decides it's time to get a car and learn to drive - but it doesn't come easily, and he soon terrifies the life out of anyone who takes him for a lesson. Quickly running out of willing instructors, the dreamboat that is Callum steps in. He is a qualified driving instructor and comes to the rescue with the promise of a lesson in a local car park.",
        "Also trying to better their lot is Methadone Mick, who has enrolled in an online course that he doesn't want to reveal to anyone, for fear they'll laugh at him. The thing is, Mick doesn't have a computer under his bridge, so he relies on Isa, Jack and Victor's good will while he completes his studies. Pushed to their limits, Jack and Victor demand to know what the course is, while the answer reveals the sorry tale of Mick's father, which might go some way to explaining Mick's troubles.",
        "Later on, it's clear the romance between Isa and Callum is blossoming, but even though her husband died years ago, Isa is uneasy about the fact she still feels married, so she seeks advice on what to do for the best. Could this be a beautifully happy-ever-after ending for Isa?"

        "The endearing pangolin is a little-known scaly mammal. Found in Africa and Asia, these shy creatures have an unfortunate tagline - they are the most poached and illegally trafficked animals in the world. Based in Namibia, conservationist Maria Diekmann rescues and rehabilitates her local pangolins. In a bid to better understand the global issues they are facing, we follow Maria to Vietnam, Thailand and China into the very heart of the crisis, where demand for pangolin products is greatest. In what turns out to be an emotional journey, Maria joins forces with a Chinese megastar to build a campaign to bring awareness to the plight of an animal most people have never even heard of."

        "Winter is a tough time for wildlife, but at Lower Moss Wood nature reserve in Cheshire they pull out all the stops to help. Steve Brown meets the volunteers and the inspirational head of the reserve Ray Jackson, who was awarded an MBE for his services to wildlife. Steve is shown the specialist hospital unit where volunteers are busy tending to some poorly hedgehogs. Ray also helps injured bats build up their strength ahead of release in the spring. Steve gets to meet some of the reserve's permanent residents, including foxes tame enough to feed by hand and the owls who wouldn't survive in the wild.",

The teams finished in the top two places last season and start the new year amongst the favourites to lift the title this year. It's derby day too for Hull KR and Hull FC who meet at Craven Park, whilst Warrington's Blake Austin is expected to make his debut for the Wolves against Leeds. Austin has arrived from Canberra Raiders and is tipped to be one of the stars of the season. London Broncos are back in Super League after their promotion last year. The Broncos first fixture is at home to Wakefield. Castleford face Catalans and Huddersfield play Salford."

        "Andrew Marr revisits the Britain of Margaret Thatcher and comes to some surprising conclusions about the British national character.",
        "Promising to restore order, confidence and national pride, Margaret Thatcher unleashed a dramatic and divisive transformation of British society. In a period of extreme ideological polarisation, British identity was redefined by the global market, and striking miners and sections of the Trade Union movement were demonised as the enemy within. Imperial visions stirred again as the fleet sailed for the Falklands. Having won power with the promise to restore traditional British values, the Thatcher government unleashed a whirlwind of privatisation and deregulation that amounted to a cultural, economic and political revolution. Heroic national rescue operation or final act of self-destruction? ",
        "This film explores the extent to which British people are all now the children of Margaret Thatcher."

        "Venice may be sinking, it may even be in peril, but da Mosto is in no mood to throw in the towel. The fate of Venice still hangs in the balance, and he puts at least some of the blame at the door of the British. From the moment that Byron put Venice on the tourist map, the city has been caught up in a trail of events that has made life harder and harder for the Venetians.",
        "But this episode is also Francesco's personal story, and he has pledged his belief in the future of Venice by continuing to live and bring up his children there, even though his life has been affected by the dangers the city faces. In the great flood of 1966 that threatened to wash the city away, he was a terrified child of five who watched the waters invade his home and wondered if life could ever continue. Francesco's father, Count da Mosto, reminisces about the 1966 floods with chilling immediacy, and Francesco swims the Grand Canal.",
        "It has not just been the tourists or the rising waters of the lagoon that have threatened the city. Outrageous ideas to bring the city into the modern age have included bridges linking the city with mainland Italy, flattening old churches and even converting the Grand Canal into an eight-lane motorway."

        "The story of Don McLean's second album American Pie. Crowned by its titular overture and the song Vincent, McLean's equally moving tribute to Van Gogh, American Pie is a classic of the folk-rock genre, earning its place alongside Carole King's Tapestry, Joni Mitchell's Blue and Neil Young's After The Goldrush as one of the landmark singer-songwriter LPs of 1971, a year recently celebrated in a book by award-winning journalist David Hepworth as 'rock's golden year'. Don McLean features in extensive new interviews, discussing the intricacies of his songs, the sometimes fraught recording process, and the album's legacy. ",
        "Forty-five years after its release, there has never been another album quite like American Pie. While a product of its era pinpointing a precise moment of cultural change in the shattered hopes of baby boomers, its impact continues to reverberate down the years with a poignancy and relevance that hasn't diminished. ",
        "The questions it raises about its country's past, present and future are as much a part of our cultural dialogue in Trump's 2017 as they were in Nixon's 1971. \"I had most of the album written without American Pie,\" explains McLean. \"But I wasn't happy with that. I knew it wasn't finished. I had more to say. I had this this really big song I needed to get out.\" ",
        "Interviewees include producer Ed Freeman and musician Jake Bugg, whose musical path was initiated when hearing Vincent for the first time on the TV, and a poignant archive performance of George Michael performing The Grave."

Would a week in Brisbane prove her right? Young couple Hannah and Zameer were struggling in the UK to make ends meet, Hannah worked 13-hour shifts, sometimes without breaks, and Zameer was constantly doing overtime to increase his family's income. Hannah truly believed he would thank her for moving the family down under - he just needed to see for himself the opportunities it could provide. For Zameer though, Australia was just the latest in a long line of Hannah's grand plans which may not work out for the best. Now three years later, did the Gaj family decide to remain in the UK or take the gamble and move down under?"

        "For Stone Age people, reaching North and South America seems impossible - on each side vast oceans, and to the north an impenetrable ice sheet that covered the whole of Canada. So how did the first Americans get there?",
        "Dr Alice Roberts discovers evidence for an ancient corridor through the Canadian ice sheet that may have allowed those first people through. But there are problems - in particular some very ancient finds in southern Chile seem to suggest a very different way in to the Americas. Amazingly, an ancient human skull discovered in Brazil even points to an Australasian origin of the Americans. Could a route from Australia across the Pacific have been possible? A surprising answer to the problem eventually comes from a Canadian forensic scientist more used to solving murder cases."

        "David Attenborough journeys to both polar regions to investigate what rising temperatures will mean for the people and wildlife that live there, and for the rest of the planet.",
        "David starts out at the North Pole, standing on sea ice several metres thick, but which scientists predict could be open ocean within the next few decades. The Arctic has been warming at twice the global average, and David heads out with a Norwegian team to see what this means for polar bears. He comes face to face with a tranquilised female and discovers that mothers and cubs are going hungry as the sea ice on which they hunt disappears. In Canada, Inuit hunters have seen with their own eyes what scientists have seen from space - the Arctic Ocean has lost 30% of its summer ice cover over the last 30 years. For some, the melting sea ice will allow access to trillions of dollars' worth of oil, gas and minerals. For the rest of us, it means the planet will get warmer, as sea ice is important to reflect back the sun's energy. Next, David travels to see what is happening to the ice on land. In Greenland, he follows intrepid ice scientists as they study giant waterfalls of meltwater, which are accelerating iceberg-calving events and ultimately leading to a rise in global sea levels.",
        "Temperatures have also risen in the Antarctic - David returns to glaciers photographed by the Shackleton expedition and reveals a dramatic retreat over the past century. It is not just the ice that is changing - ice-loving adelie penguins are disappearing and more temperate gentoo penguins are moving in. Finally, we see the first ever images of the largest recent natural event on our planet - the break up of the Wilkins Ice Shelf, an ice sheet the size of Jamaica, which shattered into hundreds of icebergs in 2009."

Just one career defining cook off remains before one of the chefs takes the crown.",

        "Tonight, the final three outstanding professionals, who have continued to stretch their abilities and surprise and dazzle the judges with incredible plates of food, face one last challenge: to cook the best three courses of their lives for the MasterChef judges. They return for the last time to the MasterChef kitchen and spend three hours creating a three-course menu of starter, main and dessert which showcases their exceptional culinary abilities. In this moment, everything is laid bare for the judges, as their plates will expose how far they have come and the magic of their unique cookery. They cannot falter, as they battle to display everything they have to offer - their talent for flavour and creativity, their ability to remain calm and controlled under immense pressure and to flawlessly deliver three plates of incredible food.",

And in Laos, he samples some local delicacies: roast squirrel (or is it rat?) and caterpillars. In Vietnam, he discovers cruelly caged moon bears, farmed for their bile, which is used in traditional medicines. ",
        "Next stop is Taiwan, and in the Tropic of Cancer primary school he meets some of the world's highest achieving children. ",
        "The journey around the world ends in Hawaii, a tropical paradise blighted by environmental problems, including some of the dirtiest beaches on the planet. ",
        "After travelling around the tropic of Capricorn and the Equator, this series completes Simon's trilogy of journeys exploring the amazing tropics region with his toughest, longest, most ambitious challenge yet."

At its peak, over 18 and a half million people sat glued to their sets as Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor battled past midnight to a final and deciding black ball, BBC Two's biggest ever audience.",
        "Colin Murray journeys around the UK filling in the gaps on the first time that he was allowed to see the other side of midnight. Along the way he finds answers to questions such as where did Dennis's 'upside-down glasses' actually come from? What really went on behind those dressing room doors? How did you spread the news in a world without mobile phones? And how different would the lives of the two protagonists have been if the result had been reversed that night?",

        "Provocative documentary following the doctors who can now interrupt, and even reverse, the process of death. Filmed over six months in the country's leading brain injury unit (Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge), it follows the journey of a man who, by only moving his eyes, is eventually asked if he wants to live or die. Two other families are also plunged into the most ethically difficult decision in modern medicine.",
        "This documentary is part of Louis Theroux: Docs That Made Me, a collection of his favourite documentaries. Many documentaries, Louis suggests, could do with losing a few minutes here and there. He makes an exception for Between Life and Death though, which doesn't waste a second with its economical storytelling. The day to day events which take place in hospitals have the potential to be highly emotional and full of drama. Nick Holt's Cambridge-based film was an inspiration for Louis Theroux's 2014 documentary, Edge of Life, about Los Angeles' famous Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre.",

        "Armed with his early 20th-century Bradshaw’s Guide, Michael Portillo continues his journey from Warrington to the Potteries in Stoke-on-Trent.In Manchester, at the magnificent Heaton Park, Michael discovers one of the first open-air concerts was held here in 1909 by an opera fan, William Grimshaw, who entertained 40,000 people to the music of opera superstar Enrico Caruso on a gramophone.In Oldham, Michael discovers the battle fought by one of Britain’s most distinguished statesmen to be elected as the town’s member of Parliament. And he uncovers the rough tactics of the election campaign.In Edale, in the beautiful Peak District, Michael joins ramblers in walking country. He learns that, at the time of his guide, landowners did not countenance intrusion and he hears how a Sheffield socialist spearheaded a mass trespassing revolt to open up the countryside to working people.Michael picks up the trail of King George V and Queen Mary, who visited the vast and Yorkshire estate of Wentworth Woodhouse in 1913. Home to one of the wealthiest dynasties in Britain, the Earls Fitzwilliam, their fortune was built on coal. Michael discovers a carefully planned royal charm offensive designed to win the affection and trust of the working classes at a time of severe industrial unrest.Michael follows the royal party’s footsteps to Lord Fitzwilliam’s mining village and colliery, where the family’s private railway line, which later connected the estate’s iron and coal works, still runs. Michael takes a trip and is permitted to operate the locomotive."

        "This episode comes from the Museum of Kent Life and looks back to the 1930s. This was a time when British farming was on the brink of mechanisation, a move which would change the face of the countryside forever. ",
        "Gerry Smith paints a vivid picture of the tough but satisfying life he led as a young farmworker in the 1930s and the sadness he felt when his beloved horses were replaced by machines.

Whilst he was there, he acquired a giant egg belonging to an extinct bird known as the 'elephant bird' - the largest bird that ever lived. It has been one of his most treasured possessions ever since. ",

On his return, scientists at Oxford University are able to reveal for the first time how old David's egg actually is, and what that might tell us about the legendary elephant bird."

",
        "From Flemish beginnings in the court of Charles I to the digital thumbstrokes of David Hockney's iPad, the paintings reveal as much about the nation's past as they do the patrons and artists who created them. Famous names sit alongside lesser-known works, covering everything from the refined sensibilities of 18th-century Classicism to the abstract forms of the war-torn 20th century with a bit of love, loss, rivalry and rioting thrown in. ",
        "Contributions come from a cast as diverse as the works themselves, including filmmaker Nic Roeg, historian Dan Snow and novelist Will Self, who offer a refreshingly wide range of perspectives on a genre of art which we have made very much our own."

        "Has one of Britain's greatest artists been unfairly forgotten? Waldemar Januszczak thinks so. In this documentary, Januszczak argues that the little known 17th-century portrait painter William Dobson was the first English painter of genius.",
        "Dobson's life and times are embedded in one of the most turbulent and significant epochs of British history - the English Civil War. As official court painter to Charles I, the tragic British king later beheaded by Parliament, Dobson had a ringside seat to an period of intense drama and conflict. Based in Oxford, where the court was transferred after Parliament took control of London, Dobson produced an astonishing number of high-quality portraits of royalist supporters, heroes and cavaliers which Januszczak believes are the first true examples of British art. As he puts it in the film: 'Dobson's face should be on our banknotes. His name should be on all our lips.'",
        "The film investigates the few known facts about William Dobson and seeks out the personal stories he left behind as it follows him through his tragically short career. When he died in 1646 - penniless, unemployed and a drunk - Dobson was just 36.",
        "Among the Dobson fans interviewed in the film is Earl Spencer, brother of Princess Diana, who agrees wholeheartedly that William Dobson was the first great British painter."

        "He visits New York's Metropolitan Museum to see the most subversive artwork of 1950s America, Jasper Johns's White Flag. Pop art defined the 1960s and Andy Warhol was its greatest artist. Andrew examines Warhol's soup can paintings, meets his former lover Billy Name and interviews one of the last great surviving pop artists, James Rosenquist.",
        "He travels west down the open road, exploring its art, arriving in Los Angeles, an artificial dream world that has inspired the graphic style of Ed Ruscha and the city's own unique contribution to 20th century design - Googie architecture.",
        "Back east, Andrew visits the home of one of his favourite 20th century artists, the late Philip Guston, and gets a private view of his work. He drops into the studio of Jeff Koons to learn how the enfant terrible of contemporary art continues to challenge the boundaries of American taste. Finally, he explores the impact 9/11 has had on America and how a new generation of artists, such as Matthew Day Jackson, have made sense of this tragic event."

This film follows a farmer, a National Park warden, a climber and a poet throughout the year and, through their intimate knowledge of Snowdonia, explores the nature of wilderness in modern Britain."

        "In the early years of the 20th century, spinster sisters Gwendoline and Margaret Davies spent much of their vast fortune buying the cream of European art as a gift to the people of Wales. When Gwendoline died in 1951, all the paintings in her collection were bequeathed to the National Museum of Wales. Amongst the works most proudly displayed were many by JMW Turner, perhaps the nation's best loved artist. These paintings were the pinnacle of the sisters' collection, carefully selected and greatly valued.",
        "Yet within months of this extraordinary act of generosity, the authenticity of the paintings was thrown into doubt by art world experts who branded them fakes. These prized exhibits were deemed 'unfit to hang on the gallery's walls'. For more than half a century a cloud has hung over three of the landscapes, said by experts to be a hand other than Turner's. But Philip believes this may be a miscarriage of justice. As Philip and Fiona investigate, they enter a murky world as they discover the paintings are connected to Turner's secret lover. In the end it will be down to the latest forensic testing in order to prove if the paintings were by Joseph Mallord William Turner. But will the process restore the Davies sisters' reputations as art connoisseurs and allow the pictures to see the light of day once again?"

With Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso resident on the coast, other artists from Jean Cocteau to Henri Lartigue, Raoul Dufy to Fernand Leger and Francis Picabia to Sergei Diaghilev were drawn to the area. ",

In an era of sunshine and bathing, of cinema and fast cars, of the Ballet Russes and Monte Carlo casinos, Grant discovers the extraordinary output of what became briefly the world's creative hub."

        "In this episode, Brian travels around Australia to explore the physics of the size of life. Beginning with the largest organisms on our planet, a forest of giant eucalyptus trees, he then takes to the seas to get up-close with an ocean giant - the great white shark. From the safety of a steel cage Brian explains how the distinctive streamlined contours of the great white have been shaped by the physics of water. ",
        "Back on land, Brian heads out to the dry dusty outback. Here he tracks the largest living marsupial, the red kangaroo, to see how giants on land adapt to gravity. This all pervasive force influences the way in which living things move and the upper limit on how large they become.",
        "Through the myriad species of insects in Queensland's rainforests, Brian begins his journey into the world of the small. At smaller scales, the effects of gravity are negligible and it is another force - the electrostatic force - that is dominant. This explains how flies and other insects can appear to defy gravity, using the traction of the electrostatic force to scale vertical windows. ",
        "But as life gets smaller, the very nature of the world appears to change as Brian explains with the aid of the tiny trichogramma wasp. This is one of the smallest multicellular life forms on Earth. For them, the atmosphere is a highly viscose environment - in a similar way to how we experience liquid - and so the trichogramma has to 'swim' through the air.",
        "Even smaller still, are the thrombolites of Lake Clifton, near Perth. These mysterious growths are made up of colonies of bacteria, the smallest free-living life forms on Earth. Here, Brian finds that the size of life has a lower limit that is governed by the size of atoms and fundamental particles, which in turn are subject to the laws of physics.",
        "The size you are not only dictates which forces of nature affect your life, it also influences your 'speed of life'. The tiny southern bent wing bat of South Australia loses heat so fast that they struggle to find enough food to stay alive. But as life gets larger, the pace of life - or metabolism - slows and this has profound consequences on life expectancy. ",
        "Brian explores this idea upon the tropical Christmas Island. This is a land of crabs of all different shapes and sizes. The largest - and most distinctive - are the giant robber crabs whose legs can span a metre. Not only are they the largest land invertebrate, they outlive their smaller cousins, some reaching well over 80 years of age. So the physics of size shapes life in many ways, not least the amount of years you get to enjoy it."

        "A sharp, witty, mind-expanding and exuberant foray into the world of logic with computer scientist Professor Dave Cliff. Following in the footsteps of the award-winning The Joy of Stats and its sequel Tails You Win - The Science of Chance, this film takes viewers on a new rollercoaster ride through philosophy, maths, science and technology- all of which, under the bonnet, run on logic. ",
        "Wielding the same wit and wisdom, animation and gleeful nerdery as its predecessors, this film journeys from Aristotle to Alice in Wonderland, sci-fi to supercomputers to tell the fascinating story of the quest for certainty and the fundamentals of sound reasoning itself. ",
        "Dave Cliff, professor of computer science and engineering at Bristol University, is no abstract theoretician. 15 years ago he combined logic and a bit of maths to write one of the first computer programs to outperform humans at trading stocks and shares. Giving away the software for free, he says, was not his most logical move...",
        "With the help of 25 seven-year-olds, Professor Cliff creates, for the first time ever, a computer made entirely of children, running on nothing but logic. We also meet the world's brainiest whizz-kids, competing at the International Olympiad of Informatics in Brisbane, Australia.",
        "The film also hails logic's all-time heroes: George Boole who moved logic beyond philosophy to mathematics; Bertrand Russell, who took 360+ pages but heroically proved that 1 + 1 = 2; Kurt Godel, who brought logic to its knees by demonstrating that some truths are unprovable; and Alan Turing, who, with what Cliff calls an 'almost exquisite paradox', was inspired by this huge setback to logic to conceive the computer.",
        "Ultimately, the film asks, can humans really stay ahead? Could today's generation of logical computing machines be smarter than us? What does that tell us about our own brains, and just how 'logical' we really are...?"

The tough rules governing where they can live and who they can see make it hard for registered sex offenders to find work or even housing, and many are forced into homelessness. ",

Stacey spends time with three prepper communities who are gearing up for uncertain futures, with concerns ranging from civil unrest and nuclear war to climate change and natural disasters. Some have bought bunkers to escape to, others have isolated themselves from society. Stacey explores the reasons why they are going to such lengths to protect themselves. And she asks - should I be following their lead?"

        "The story of the final four years in the lives of Tsar Nicholas II's four daughters - Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia - concluding with their brutal murders in the bloody climax to the Russian revolution. Interviews with leading historians, archive footage and dramatic reconstruction reveal the real women behind the familiar images of beautiful girls in white dresses. ",
        "In 1914 Olga and Tatiana were 18 and 16 and old enough to be married off to eligible princes, but any prospect of escaping their strange and very isolated life in the Alexander Palace was thwarted by the outbreak of the First World War. The war destroyed all trace of the life the sisters had known, but when Olga and Tatiana volunteered as Red Cross nurses they did enjoy a brief taste of the real world beyond the palace gates. The sisters became very close to some of the dashing young officers they nursed and Olga's touching diary entries reveal how she fell passionately in love with one particular Georgian officer, Dmitri Shakh-Bagov. ",
        "March 1917 brought a dramatic end to over three centuries of Romanov rule and following their father's abdication the girls were forced to adjust to a world turned upside down. After five months under house arrest at the Alexander Palace the girls, along with the rest of their family, were sent into exile in Siberia. The sisters' letters from Siberia bring the boredom, frustration and uncertainty of their captivity powerfully to life. For much of their tragically short lives the girls had been as much prisoners as princesses and in their final weeks in exile in Siberia that imprisonment was absolute - the whitewashed windows of the house where they were held denied them even a glimpse of the outside world."

",

These include Dolly Parton, Charley Pride, Willie Nelson, Ricky Skaggs, Steve Earle, Kris Kristofferson and several hit-making contemporary stars - Kasey Musgraves, Brad Paisley and Jason Aldean. This cast reveal the unique power of country music to hold up a mirror to its fans and create a music that has - for decades - touched the hearts of the south and of working people. Kristofferson calls it the 'white man's soul music'.",

Several of Nashville's younger stars describe their ongoing journey from their hometowns in the south to the streets of this city, from the first studio demos and the sawdust of the Broadway bars to the stadiums and promo videos that now define country stardom."

BBC Two was making over homes by chucking out the chintz, turning gardens into outside rooms and kitchens into pukka Jamie Oliver zones. But it didn't stop there. Soon there was a craze for decluttering and minimal living linked to the crazed flipping of homes in the mortgage-mad Noughties. Inevitably, a slew of programmes about buying and selling property, homes in the country and living abroad followed.",

        "Alaska is huge - by far the biggest US state - and still one of the wildest places on earth. It has deep forests and vast mountain ranges, and a third of it sits above the Arctic Circle. The whole state goes through some of the most extreme seasonal changes: temperatures can reach into the 90s F (30s C) in the summer and can plummet to -80F (-60C) in the winter.",
        "Yet plenty survives here - Alaska is home to some of the hardiest animals on the planet. Each one has its own quirky way of getting through the challenges of the seasons. Above all, this is a land of great characters.",
        "Black bear cubs are faced with a daunting climb down from their tree den and a mother sea otter nurses her baby through the chilly days of early spring. Stealthy 50-tonne sperm whales steal fish from the end of fishermen's lines in an extraordinary marine 'heist', grizzly bears grow big on a sudden wealth of salmon, and a huge male moose finds unlikely ways to impress a female. Thousands of bald eagles gather for a winter feast, and arctic foxes risk everything to find food in the alien world of an oil boomtown. People, too, must go with the flow of the extreme seasons, facing winter storms at sea to catch snow crabs, rushing across ice rivers with teams of huskies and taking advantage of Alaska's endless summer daylight to grow world-class giant vegetables.",
        "Surviving the bone-chilling cold, deadly blizzards and darkness of an Alaskan winter takes courage, cunning and remarkable endurance. In the raw beauty of windswept mountain peaks, icy tundra and snowbound forests, this is the story of the tough and resourceful characters that face up to the ultimate challenges of this untameable land."

And using the latest technology reveals how we can actually see back in time to reveal the landscape as it would have looked when King John made his last journey 800 years ago."

        "Louis Theroux heads to California, the US adoption capital, where the majority of newborn adoptions are carried out privately, creating a multimillion dollar industry. Agencies, facilitators and lawyers can earn thousands of dollars per baby by matching up pregnant women prepared to give up their newborns with adoptive parents willing to pay up to $50,000 for the privilege. ",
        "Louis spends time with the birth mothers preparing to hand over their own flesh and blood, uncovering the stories of poverty, addiction and abuse that can push these women into making such a heartbreaking decision. ",
        "He also meets the adoptive families, paying out huge amounts of money in the hope of being able to raise a child they can't have by natural means - but in a system open to abuse, whether the birth mum hands over the baby hangs in the balance until after the birth."

        "In her final journey of the series, Kate Humble travels deep into the southern Gobi Desert in Mongolia to live with an extended family of cashmere goat and yak herders. Here in the seemingly barren wastes of Asia's largest desert, nomads have lived cheek by jowl with nature for centuries. Chimid, the 78-year-old mother of ten, welcomes Kate into her large family. With their herds of goats, sheep, horses and yaks, this family are successful nomads. They move four times a year with the seasons across the Gobi, to sheltered winter pastures and mountaintop summer grazing.",
        "It's claimed that 30 per cent of Mongolia's population still live a nomadic existence. Nomadism was banned under a Communist regime, but when it collapsed in the 1990s thousands of nomads returned to the Gobi. They continue to battle the harsh weather and attacks from wild predators, wolves and snow leopards. But they are adapting to the 21st century, embracing its benefits like satellite dishes, mobile phones and 4x4s. And despite the modern-day threats of the burgeoning mining industry and the temptations of urban living, these Mongolian nomads seem to have found a balance between tradition and the modern world."

        "With thousands of miles under their belts, Dave and Si are delighted to arrive in Sweden, home to some of the world's top chefs and the Nordic cuisine that has put them there. Crossing the Arctic Circle into Lapland, the Bikers get straight back to basics with the Sami people, who have been cooking this way for centuries. They quickly learn that it's all about keeping it local, fresh and simple. ",
        "The Samis introduce them to the traditional techniques of smoking to cure meat, manufacturing their own hunting knives and fishing to stock up for the coming winter. Inspired by it all, and with some of the best local ingredients at hand, the bikers treat their hosts to a berry and almond rice pudding and put together their own Nordic reindeer and fish dishes before hitting the road. With a hunger to know more about the traditional life of the reindeer herders, the bikers head deep into the wilderness to meet Lars, one the last surviving forest Sami folk. In the true community spirit of Sweden, the boys are also invited to a house-jumping dinner in the village of Voullerim for a feast of local specialities and a cultural introduction to the Swedes. In a country well known for its love of nature and design talent, the boys toast the end of their northern Swedish adventure in the architecturally stunning tree house rooms of the Tree Hotel."

As the language declined, it was still able to throw up literary geniuses who saved Scots from obscurity and obliteration. Scottish poets like Robbie Burns and Hugh MacDiarmid kept Scots literature burning bright. In Ulster, Tim explores the genius of James Orr, the largely forgotten Ballycarry poet who many literary experts regard as the equal of Burns.",

        "Emperor penguins are the only animals to breed in the Antarctic winter, and after months of blizzards and temperatures of -60C, male emperor penguins are watching and waiting for their chicks to hatch. Snow Chick is the last to emerge into this harsh, frozen world. ",
        "As he takes his first steps, he tries to fit in with the baby penguin gang, but when you are so small, it is hard to be accepted by the bigger chicks. Soon, he ventures too far from his mother for comfort and gets lost in a storm. Later, he is chased by chick-snatching penguins and escapes a scavenging petrel by the fluff of his back - all the while slipping and skating on treacherous ice. ",
        "With the arrival of the comical and pugnacious adelie penguin, colony life is turned upside down. But it signals a bigger change - the parents who braved long and treacherous journeys across the sea ice to bring back food eventually return no more. With his band of penguin brothers, Snow Chick has no choice but to make his own way to the sea. A few more adventures lie ahead before he gets tossed unceremoniously into the open ocean - his new home for the next four years.",
        "An enchanting and action-packed dramatised Christmas treat, featuring one of the cutest and toughest creatures on earth. Filming over a whole Antarctic year, the crew endured some of the toughest conditions on earth to capture these astonishing moments of intimate behaviour."

Dan's incredibly excited - he loves weddings, and this one is going to be pretty spectacular, as Jack is marrying the extremely wealthy Ophelia at their country mansion. Hannah can't wait to get snooping and see what life is really like for these Downton wannabes.",

Yet this lush wetland of islands and lagoons lies in the middle of the vast, featureless Kalahari Desert. This is the story of how it happens. Following groups of wildlife, including hippos, baboons, catfish, kingfishers, leopards, warthogs and elephants, the film reveals how the yearly flood transforms the landscape and impacts their lives. But more surprisingly, it reveals how, with the help of termites and hippos, the flood actually creates this extraordinary delta in the first place."

        "Through the 1960s, 70s and 80s, Alberts created a house of hits in Australia that literally changed the sound of Australian popular music.",
        "It started with The Easybeats and their international hit Friday on My Mind back in the 60s. In the 1970s when Australia was in the midst of a deep recession, a rough and ready pub rock sound emerged, characterised by bands like Rose Tattoo who were promoted by family-run company Alberts. The raw power and fat guitar sound that characterised Aussie rock was pioneered by the Alberts and took Australia and the world by storm.",
        "The sound of Aussie rock really exploded when the Alberts, a well-to-do family from the Sydney suburbs, joined forces with the Youngs, a Glasgow family who had emigrated to Australia. The result was AC/DC.",
        "The documentary tells the story of how brothers Angus and Malcolm Young were produced by their older brother George and fellow Easybeats member Harry Vanda. Vanda and Young produced the band at Albert Studios and they were soon joined by the wild and charismatic lead singer Bon Scott.",
        "Head of Alberts was Ted Albert - a quietly confident risk-taker. He backed AC/DC for many years with rock-solid conviction when their type of music and fashion seemed completely at odds with a UK and US music scene dominated by punk. Then, in 1980, AC/DC's Back in Black album was a massive success around the world and the rest is history. The film retraces the band's explosion in popularity, the relentless touring and the tragic death of Bon Scott.",
        "Even after Bon's death, and with the addition of Brian Johnson, the band went from strength to strength and remain hugely popular and one of the world's most legendary bands. Today, the Albert family remains a potent force in Australian music."

        "A documentary series about the unprecedented number of executions scheduled in Arkansas, USA, of eight men in ten days. The Governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, has scheduled eight men to be put to death within ten days of each other. The reason for the unprecedented timetable is to use up the state's supply of a lethal injection drug called midazolam before it expires. With access to the families of victims, and of those on death row, this series follows the eight cases from both sides, in the weeks, days, hours and minutes leading up to each scheduled execution. From inside the prison walls, we also hear from the inmates themselves as they reflect on their crimes, plead for their lives and get ready to be part of the most condensed spate of death sentences in recent American history.",
        "In this episode, the family of murdered teenager John Melbourne Jr are fighting for the execution of death row inmate Jason McGehee to go ahead. McGehee's lawyers argue that his sentence is unjust, as he is only one out of a group of teenagers responsible for the murder. In fact, the person who actually took John's life is eligible for parole in 2025.",
        "We also meet Kayla Greenwood, whose father Michael was murdered by death row inmate Kenneth Williams in a road traffic collision after he escaped from prison. In an extraordinary act of forgiveness, Kayla is desperate to reconnect the killer with the daughter, Jasmine, he hasn't seen for 17 years."

        "Don and Phil Everly's love of music began as children, encouraged by their father Ike. Little Donnie and Baby Boy Phil sang on Ike's early morning radio shows in Iowa.",
        "After leaving school, the brothers moved to Nashville where, under the wing of Ike Everly's friend, the highly talented musician Chet Atkins, Don and Phil signed with Cadence Records. They exploded onto the music scene in 1957 with Bye Bye Love, written by Boudleaux and Felice Bryant.",
        "After Bye Bye Love came other hits, notably Wake Up Little Susie, followed by the worldwide smash hit All I Have to Do Is Dream and a long string of other great songs which also became hits.",
        "By 1960, however, the brothers were lured away from Cadence to Warner Bros with a $1,000,000 contract. Their biggest hit followed, the self-penned Cathy's Clown, which sold 8 million copies. Remaining at Warner Bros for most of the 60s, they had further success with Walk Right Back, So Sad and the King/Greenfield-penned track Crying in the Rain."

Hundreds of residential high-rise towers are being built at record speed, many hugely controversial, as private developers cotton on to what social housing idealists realised 60 years ago. ",
        "Dan is in Bow in east London, charting the extraordinary history of one estate - the Lincoln. Designed in 1960 for the London County Council by a young idealistic architect, the 19-storey Lincoln was once the tallest residential building in London. Inside every flat were the latest space-age gadgets - a lift, a shower and a fitted kitchen. But the dream turned sour. The Lincoln became notorious for drugs and violence. There was even a brutal murder. It was the same all over Britain - the flat was a byword for deprivation and social exclusion. But then, just as everything looked lost, the Lincoln was saved and with, perhaps, the hopes of an entire generation for that most precious of things - a home. For Dan, as perhaps for Britain, 'the only way is up'."

        "Two iconic British buildings are threatened with demolition and the intrepid Nick Broomfield is on the case. In a pair of documentaries, Broomfield profiles the Wellington Rooms in Liverpool and the Coal Exchange in Cardiff.",
        "The Wellington Rooms, built in 1815 by Edmund Aikin, was originally the social hub for the super-rich, slave traders, businessmen and the elite. The prime minister William Gladstone's family, themselves wealthy slave owners, invested heavily in this magnificent building with the most intricate detailing and proportions. A Wedgwood ceiling and sprung dance floor, with classical columns, create a building of love and light. ",
        "Despite the depression in Liverpool's fortunes, it's a building that has brought enormous happiness to many different people over a couple of centuries. Countless people seem to have fallen in love and met their future partners in the assembly room. Now in a rundown state of faded glory, the question is - what to do with the Wellington Rooms?",
        "The Coal Exchange in Cardiff, built in 1883 by Edward Seward, is a magnificent celebration of the industry of coal and its immense wealth. A glass-ceilinged exchange room with galleries on three floors and a unique lowered floor are a remarkable monument to this time. ",
        "Now in serious neglect, the whole building, the size of a city block, faces demolition. It signifies the serious lack of resourcefulness on the part of Cardiff Council to celebrate and regenerate not only this building but the whole area. The once great Butetown Docks and the magnificent buildings surrounding the Coal Exchange have also been allowed to crumble and disintegrate. Rather than redevelop the docks in a way that they have been so wonderfully done in Liverpool, the docks in Cardiff have been filled in. Magnificent warehouses have been torn down, and the whole history of coal and the uniqueness of this area have been almost obliterated."

        "1,400 miles of rugged, windswept and rocky coastline in what is now the Alaskan panhandle, British Columbia and Washington state have been home to hundreds of distinct communities for over 10,000 years. Theirs is the longest continuing culture to be found anywhere in the Americas. They mastered a tough environment to create unique and complex communities that have redefined how human societies develop. They produced art infused with meaning that ranks alongside any other major civilisation on earth. And they were very nearly wiped out - by foreign disease, oppression and theft of their lands. But a deep connection to the environment lies at the heart of their endurance and, unlike many indigenous cultures annihilated following European contact, their culture sustains and has much to offer the rest of the world today.",
        "Jago sees how a complex society developed without agriculture. The answer lies in the extraordinary way in which the people understood and mastered their environment, which in turn is reflected in their identity and social structures. He reveals the hidden significance in totem poles, canoes and intricate textiles, arguing that the peoples of the north west coast achieved the highest levels of cultural achievement."

They disclose the previously unknown processes, single-mindedness and sometimes sheer unpleasantness and discrimination that lay behind his seemingly effortless masterpieces. Through bankruptcy, strikes, great risk and more, Disney's refusal to accept failure and his single-minded pursuit of his creative vision produced cartoons and movies that would define an entire industry. Both and inspiring story and a cautionary tale about the price of ambition, Walt Disney offers an unprecedented look at the man who created a world and built an empire.",

        "This week, Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge travels the country to find out what makes the best fish and chips and the trade secrets behind them, while Cherry Healey discovers that the origins of our national dish aren't actually British at all. Then, three of the nation's top chippies are invited to compete in a contest at one of Britain's oldest fishing ports, Brixham Harbour. Each is passionate about their own style of cooking but they all have very different ideas about what makes the best fish and chips. For one, it is haddock and beef dripping, for another it is cod, and for the third it is a reinvention of the dish itself. So it is down to Tom and his expert judge, fish restaurateur Mitch Tonks, to decide who makes the best takeaway on the day."

They're not the only minority at odds with the authorities in Turkey; Simon sees first-hand the devastating effects of fighting in the country's Kurdish region. In an area where the government has detained foreign journalists, Simon gathers unique footage in the aftermath of a crackdown on Kurdish militants - the wholesale destruction of the historic centre of one of Turkey's oldest cities.",
        "Away from the conflict in the south, Simon heads towards the Black Sea coast. He meets a wildlife conservationist protecting Turkey's population of brown bears, and villagers who still communicate over long distances using an ancient bird language. In the country's capital he meets a victim of President Erdogan's authoritarian purge of people accused of complicity in the failed coup against him. ",
        "Finally Simon's journey comes full circle when he returns to Istanbul - home to the new craze of 'Ottomania', a celebration of the vast empire that preceded modern Turkey. Simon visits the set of one of the world's most popular TV dramas - even getting a speaking role - based in the court of an Ottoman sultan."

        "Adventurer and journalist Simon Reeve heads to one of the most spectacular countries in the world - Colombia. For 50 years, Colombia has been in the grip of a brutal civil war that has killed more than 200,000 people and displaced seven million. But in late 2016, a peace deal was signed promising to end the conflict and finally bring peace to the country.",
        "In this hour-long documentary for the award-winning This World strand, Simon explores Colombia at a pivotal point in its history. He travels into the jungle and comes face to face with the guerrilla army Farc, which is now promising to lay down arms. In the Pacific coast city of Buenaventura, Simon finds out more about the fearsome right-wing paramilitary gangs who now dominate the cocaine trade. As the Farc abandon the countryside, there is a fear that these groups will only grow in power. Travelling in the countryside, Simon meets the coca farmers who are demanding government support to stop growing coca and stop the flow of money to criminal gangs. With land ownership, poverty and drugs at the heart of Colombia's problems, it is in the countryside that the country's precarious future will be decided."

        "But before he gets there, Ben has some preparation to do: in the airplane toilet, he shaves his beard off. This is a country in which people have been dragged off the streets for sporting overly long facial hair.",
        "Landing in the capital city Dushanbe, Ben heads to see one of Tajikistan's biggest claims to fame: the second tallest flagpole in the world. Of course it was built as the tallest, but has now been pipped to the top spot by Saudi Arabia, another dictatorship. Other authoritarian regimes dominate the Big Five when it comes to flagpoles - countries like North Korea, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan. Could it be, wonders Ben, that while rich middle-aged men get a fast car as a midlife crisis-inspired penis enlargement, dictators go for giant flagpoles instead?",
        "Still wowed by the size of the pole, Ben goes to meet a man called Rustam, who was forcibly shaved by the police a couple of years ago. He finds out that the president of Tajikistan is worried about beards because he's terrified of Islamic radicalism. To find out more about how the government is keeping control of radical Islam, Ben heads to meet Aslideen, a youth activist who set up a movement that does the government's dirty work for it - keeping an eye on people out on the streets, reporting any suspicious behaviour to the police and generally terrorising the locals. Tajikistan is starting to feel like a police state in which independent thought is quickly stifled.",
        "On a mission to find some signs of dissent, Ben goes to meet a prominent young hip-hop artist. Around the world, hip-hop is a way for the youth to express their frustration; surely the rapper Baron will tell Ben what's wrong with this country? Instead, Ben finds Baron rapping about how great the president is, and he tells Ben that it would be stupid for him to rap about anything critical of the regime.",
        "It seems the population is so well trained that the government barely even needs to censor people. Though of course if it has to, it will, and it's more than happy to shut down any social media sites that become a problem. When a video of the president dancing embarrassingly at his son's wedding ended up doing the rounds online, the president did what any self-respecting dictator would do - he shut down YouTube in the country.",
        "As Ben is shown a beautiful but simple mountain village, surrounded by snow-capped peaks in the middle of nowhere, the secret police suddenly turn up. The country may be poor, but there's always money for flagpoles and the surveillance of dissent."

        "But it is a city looking westwards, eager to turn itself into a tourist destination. They discover a city for which oil has been both a blessing and a curse. The profits from oil transformed its architecture twice - first in the late nineteenth century, and again in the twentieth.",
        "As a result, Baku is full of buildings that feel like 19th-century Paris, but also gleaming new structures by architectural stars like Zaha Hadid. And all around, the traces of Soviet rule offer other surprising clashes of art and architecture.",
        "Nina and Alastair pick their way through this maze of influences and travel back in time, seeking the roots of Azerbaijani identity. Alastair visits the world's first museum devoted entirely to rugs while Nina marvels at stunning prehistoric rock art on the city's outskirts. Together they wander the medieval old city, discovering the early impact of Islamic culture.",
        "And in the stunning Heydar Aliyev Centre designed by Zaha Hadid, they discover an exhibition devoted to Heydar Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, whose government exerts a strong influence on the city's art and culture. But Alistair also meets Sabina Shikhlinskaya, an artist with a truly independent voice.",
        "As night falls they discover why Azerbaijan is known as the 'Land of Fire' when they visit Yanar Dag, a spectacular 10-metre long natural gas fire which blazes continuously. And they end their visit to Baku with a performance of Maugham, Azerbaijan's ancient, haunting folk music as they reflect on their time in a city that has fascinated and surprised them both."

        "He was lanky, he wore glasses and he sang as if permanently battling hiccups. Aesthetically, Buddy Holly might have been the most unlikely looking rock 'n' roll star of the 50s. But he was, after Elvis Presley, unquestionably the most influential.",
        "It was an all-too-brief career that lasted barely 18 months from That'll Be The Day topping the Billboard charts to the plane crash in February 1959 in Iowa that took Holly's life. That day was immortalised in Don McLean's 1971 song American Pie, and has become known as 'the day the music died'.",
        "This film tells the story of Buddy Holly's tragically short life and career through interviews with those who knew him and worked with him. This combined with contributions from music fans paints a picture of an artist who changed music. Rock 'n' roll started with Elvis, but pop music started with Buddy Holly and The Crickets.",
        "In an age of solo stars, Holly also led the first recognisable 'pop' group, The Crickets, who in name alone inspired The Beatles. As a songwriter, he revolutionised rock 'n' roll by introducing dynamic new rhythms and unpredictable melodies beyond its traditional blues roots. In his songs, written and recorded in the late 50s, we can already hear the beat group sound of the 60s and beyond.",
        "Buddy Holly's story remains one of the most dramatic tales in rock 'n' roll, one which nearly 60 years after his breakthrough hit That'll Be The Day, deserves to be told again for a new generation. His life was tragically short. His legacy is triumphantly infinite."

        "Alder Hey Children's Hospital has a world-class reputation for cutting-edge procedures in treating congenital heart defects. Children from across the north west and Wales are referred to the three heart surgeons who operate in the country's first hybrid theatre, in a paediatric standalone centre, capable of high-tech imaging and surgical procedures at the same time - within different specialities such as heart, brain and spinal surgery. But when the number of seriously ill children increases across Alder Hey, the hospital's status escalates to red - when capacity is at a critical level. Intensive Care is full and has to close to new admissions. There are no free paediatric intensive care beds across the whole of the north west.",
        "Before the cardiac team can go ahead with an operation they must secure an intensive care bed for each of their young patients for when they come out of surgery. Despite aiming to perform four hundred operations a year, there are over 80 children on the cardiac surgeons' waiting list. When the 21-bed intensive care unit is at capacity operations must be cancelled. Staffing pressures mean the Intensive Care coordinator has to take on the responsibility of four team leaders on the unit. When a crash on the motorway between Manchester and Liverpool closes the route to work for many hospital staff, the already stretched clinical teams push on into double shifts.",
        "Scheduled operations are cancelled to make way for the emergencies. The three paediatric cardiac surgeons stand down and wait. For two weeks running this world class team has managed less than half of their scheduled operations.",
        "Casey-Jack is only hours old. He was born with a congenital heart defect, discovered during his mum's 20-week scan. He has a hole in his heart and a damaged main artery. He has arrived at the Alder Hey for an operation to repair his heart, no bigger than a strawberry, as one consultant describes it. But when Casey-Jack suddenly crashes, he is rushed to Intensive Care, taking the one remaining bed. Hence, ICU is full.",
        "Five-year-old Aaima arrives at the hospital for a scheduled third and final heart operation to redirect a vein to improve the blood flow. After her first operation she had a cardiac arrest. She, too, needed an emergency intensive care bed. Her parents have driven 40 miles from Manchester but with Casey-Jack's sudden deterioration, Aaima's reserved post-op ICU bed has been taken and the unit is full. The family must go home, and Aaima is booked in for two days later. When the family return, there is no ICU bed again. Aaima will have to come back for a third time as the Alder Hey team work to ensure that this time a bed will be free.",
        "Three-month-old Edith urgently needs surgery, as she only has half a functioning heart. Her lungs can't get the oxygen they need from her undeveloped arteries. She is on a machine supporting both organs. Edith hasn't taken an unassisted breath for almost a month. Even for these specialists this is not a routine operation as they try to widen and scaffold the narrow arteries. They will completely stop Edith's tiny heart to reduce the risk of a fatal bleed. There is a 15 to 20 per cent risk that she may not survive but this 11-hour operation is the only chance she has.",

With Andy Serkis reading the voice of Hokusai, the film features artists David Hockney and Maggi Hambling, and passionate scholars who study, admire and venerate this great Japanese master. ",
        "The film focuses on Hokusai's work, life and times in the great, bustling metropolis of Edo, now modern Tokyo. Using extraordinary close-ups and pioneering 8K Ultra HD video technology, Hokusai's prints and paintings are examined by world experts. In the process they reveal new interpretations of famous works and convey the full extent of Hokusai's extraordinary achievement as a great world artist. ",
        "Hokusai spent his life studying and celebrating our common humanity as well as deeply exploring the natural and spiritual worlds, using the famous volcano Mount Fuji as a protective presence and potential source of immortality. He knew much personal tragedy, was struck by lightning and lived for years in poverty, but never gave up his constant striving for perfection in his art. Hokusai influenced Monet, Van Gogh and other Impressionists, is the father of manga, and has his own Great Wave emoji."

This leads him to uncover the story of the only coal mine in the Highlands and a seam that runs all the way to Ireland. Heading up Loch Fyne, Paul joins the last of the Ring Net fishermen onboard a restored fishing boat heading to Lochgilphead, where he tracks down the inventor of Scotland's lost supercar - the Argyll Turbo.

But when a mysterious stranger offers to share with Will a tale of redemption, he becomes filled anew with love and light and hope. Now Will has a mission - to save another soul from despair. He and his family and friends get together to save Greene from a mean and miserly life, and arrange for three midnight 'ghosts' to visit him before Christmas.",
        "Who is the stranger? Can Will and his family and friends' efforts persuade Greene to change his ways and show some generosity to his servant Job Scratchit? And at the end of it all, could this tale of Yuletide redemption be another smash Shakespeare hit on the stage, or is its time not yet come? In short, what the Dickens is going on?"

President Putin's government is investing heavily in the illegally occupied territory - building a huge bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Simon meets the eccentric and fearless owner of a safari park who likes to get up close and personal with his pride of lions. The owner is struggling to get water to his park after a canal that supplied much of Crimea's water was shut off by the Ukraine. And it is not just the lions that are affected - the diminishing water supplies are now beginning to threaten a humanitarian crisis.",

At a small cottage hospital he meets an inspiring doctor trying to protect his clinic from closure. Arriving in Moscow, he meets a victim of Russia's draconian laws against protests."

        "Imagine a world in which you can think but cannot speak. For many stroke survivors, like former football star Junior and landlord Barry, this nightmare is a reality. ",
        "Inspired by the experience of his brother-in-law, filmmaker Richard Alwyn has made an intensely moving, personal film about language and its loss. Alwyn’s brother-in-law, journalist Dennis Barker, had a stroke in 2011 which left him speaking a bizarre, fluent gibberish – just one manifestation of the condition ‘aphasia’ in which people lose or have a severely impaired ability to use language. ",
        "SPEECHLESS tells the powerful stories of two men who can no longer take language for granted. Much of the film is made on the Neuro Rehab Unit of the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London’s Queen Square. There, Alwyn meets 55 year old Barry who has been in hospital for 4 months since a stroke left him barely able to speak. Courageous and determined, Barry’s personality constantly triumphs where his language fails. And two years after his stroke when just 35 years-old, former Premier League and international footballer Junior Agogo is still visiting the Unit as he battles to find his way in the world with depleted language. “I had thoughts but I’m saying, where was my voice? I was baffled, man.”",
        "SPEECHLESS raises questions that straddle philosophy and science. Can we understand the world if we don’t have language to name and describe it? Can we think without language? How much is our identity wrapped up in language? These questions are at the heart of conversations that Alwyn has with clinicians and therapists working to get Barry and Junior back into the world. ",
        "SPEECHLESS is fascinating and moving, upsetting and uplifting in its depiction of the isolating and estranging condition, aphasia."

      "long_synopsis": [
        "Michael Wood explores the life, works and influence of one of the world's greatest storytellers who died 2,000 years ago. When an Elizabethan literary critic said that the witty soul of Ovid lived on in 'honey tongued Shakespeare', they were just stating the obvious. Ovid, everyone knew, was simply the most clever, sexy and funny poet in the western tradition. His Metamorphoses, it has often been said, is the most influential secular book in European literature.",
        "Unique among ancient poets, Ovid left us an autobiography, full of riveting intimacy, as well as ironical and slippery self-justification. Using Ovid's own words, brought to life by one of Britain's leading actors, Simon Russell Beale, the film tells the story of the poet's fame, and his fateful falling out with the most powerful man in the world, the Roman emperor Augustus.",
        "Born in Sulmona in central Italy, Ovid moved to Rome to study law but, seduced by 'the muse of poetry', he soon abandoned that career path. Part of Rome's postwar, young generation, Ovid rose to spectacular fame with his poems about sex - Love Affairs (Amores) and The Art of Love (Ars Amatoria) - an amoral guide to seduction and adultery. Today some of his poems are seen as problematic and even carry a health warning when studied in US universities. But he is difficult to pigeonhole as he also took the female side in a powerful series of fictional letters by women heroes.",
        "By his twenties he was a literary superstar and a thorn in the emperor's side, his poetry of sex and seduction falling foul of the emperor's new puritanism, which had even outlawed adultery. In the midst of a sensational sex scandal involving his daughter, the Emperor Augustus banished Ovid to the farthest edge of the empire - the wilds of the Black Sea coast and the marshes of the Danube delta. It's a tale full of sex, drama and scandal, but his banishment is still a mystery- as he put it, 'my downfall was all because of a poem - and a mistake- and on the latter my lips are sealed forever'.",
        "Exile in Romania was unbelievably harsh and dangerous, but worse for Ovid was a sense of separation and loss. His poetry from the Black Sea has inspired the European literature of exile for millennia, from Dante and Petrarch to Mandelstam and Seamus Heaney. The poems, the mystery, and Ovid's immense legacy in world literature and art, are discussed with leading experts, who trace his influence on, among others, Titian, Turner and even Bob Dylan, whose Modern Times album quarries Ovid's exile poetry. His greatest and most influential work Metamorphoses, a compendium of the great tales of Greek myth, became one of the core texts of Western culture. Artistic director of the RSC, Greg Doran looks at Ovid's influence on Shakespeare and the myths in the Metamorphoses that pervade our art, music, and literature. Professor Alessandro Schiesaro discusses Ovid and the postmodern imagination; Professor Roy Gibson untangles his relations with Augustus; while Dr Jennifer Ingleheart, author of a new study on Roman sexual politics, looks at Ovid's ambition, psychology and influence. Lisa Dwan -the leading interpreter of the drama of Samuel Beckett, another exile and Ovid fan, explores the poet's use of the female voice and his poetry of exile, which has influenced western writers and artists for the last two millennia.",
        "Following in Ovid's footsteps, Michael Wood travels from the poet's birthplace in the beautiful town of Sulmona, to the bright lights of the capital, Rome. Here we visit the Houses of Augustus and Livia, recently opened after 25 years of excavation and conservation. Inside the emperor's private rooms glow with the colour of their newly restored frescoes. Wood then follows Ovid into exile in Constanta in today's Romania, and on to the Danube delta, where dramatic footage shows the Danube and the Black Sea frozen over in winter just as Ovid described in his letters.",
        "Throughout the film Ovid's own words reveal an engaging personality: a voice of startling modernity. 'He is funny, irreverent, focused on pleasure and obsessed with sex' says Prof Roy Gibson. But, says Greg Doran, he is also a poet of cruelty and violence, which especially fascinated Shakespeare. Ovid raises very modern questions about the fluidity of identity and gender, and the mutability of nature. He also explores the relationship between writers and power and the experience of exile, themes especially relevant in our time when, as Lisa Dwan observes, exile has become part of the human condition. But above all, says Michael Wood, Ovid is the Poet of Love, and 2,000 years after his death he is back in focus as one of the world's greatest poets: ironical, profound, and relevant."

        "Alinka Echeverria reveals the way in which Mexican artists shook off European artistic influence to find a distinctive voice, expressed through landscape painting, and reconnected with pre-Hispanic subject matter. The murals of Teotihuacan and illustrated Aztec codices show how nature was the reference point for their worldview, their power structures and their calendars. But following the conquest in the 16th century, the Spanish 're-educated' indigenous artists to aspire to European aesthetics, and for nearly 300 years after conquest, the art of what was called New Spain looked a lot like the art of old Spain.",
        "A century after independence in 1810, artists began to depict Mexico's ancient foundation myths, including the symbolic volcanoes that dominate the Valley of Mexico. Indigenous people, their land and lives were no longer taboo. Following the Mexican Revolution that began in 1910, landscape paintings established a new style that was resolutely Mexican and confirmed the re-established connections between Mexico's indigenous population and their land. Forces of nature and Mexico's landscape continue to be integral to the Mexican sense of artistic identity."

        "Andrew Graham-Dixon and Giorgio Locatelli continue their exploration of Rome off the beaten track. In search of its Papal, Renaissance and Baroque history, they discover that it is visible all around them. In Rome, everything has been kept, from broken cooking pots from the time of the empire that piled up to form one of the city's hills to the gastronomy, art and architecture created not just by successive popes and Caesars but by ordinary Romans.",
        "As well as marvelling at the mosaics in the 12th-century Basilica di San Clemente, Andrew takes Giorgio to its deepest basement and an ancient Roman schoolteacher's classroom. Then it is on to a true architectural and civic wonder - the vast Testaccio Slaughterhouse, where workers were once paid in offal which they took home and used as the basis of delicious dishes that are still sold in Rome today. Giorgio takes Andrew to his favourite Trippa stall to sample some of the best. Travelling to the Palazzo Colonna, Andrew in turn wants to show Giorgio just one painting - the Beaneater by Carracci, a Baroque masterpiece that makes an everyday subject extraordinary. Finally, together they discover Rome's Fascist architecture, which might have been destroyed anywhere else, but here remains standing in a city that houses all of its history. To understand the truth about the past, they argue, you have to taste all its layers - just like one of Giorgio's lasagnes."

        "In 1998, wildlife enthusiast and photographer Chris Packham had a remarkable encounter with the Orang Rimba, a tribe of hunter gatherers in the rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia. It was the first time he had ever seen people living in perfect harmony with their environment. One photograph in particular that Chris took, a picture of a young tribal girl, has since become immensely important to him as a barometer of how we are treating our planet. In this real-life detective story, with no clues as to her identity or whereabouts other than his original photograph, Chris sets off to Sumatra 20years on to try to find her; the girl in the picture.",
        "Chris's search is further complicated because her tribe is nomadic and often cover vast distances on foot, and since he was last there, millions of hectares of her rainforest habitat has been destroyed. Piecing together the clues, Chris discovers to his horror that the girl's close-knit group of Orang Rimba was attacked not long after he met them, and a number of them killed. But was the girl among them?",
        "Chris travels into the heart of Sumatra and tries to discover the girl's fate by meeting the men who pulled the murdered tribespeople's bodies out of the river. On his way, he discovers just how much of Sumatra's once pristine rainforests have been replaced by palm oil plantations, palm oil whichis in around 50% of the products we buy in our supermarkets. Chris learns some uncomfortable truths about how we are all in some way connected to deforestation.",
        "As Chris's investigation reaches its dramatic conclusion, will he find the lost girl alive? If so, will she be living in harmony with nature as she was 20 years ago? Or will Chris discover the deforestation of her island has had terrible consequences for her?"

        "Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall is back with the last instalment of his series on a national health crisis that he's determined to do something about. In this final showdown, he examines some of the misleading marketing claims on 'healthier' products, unveils the truth about why Brits love to snack and challenges a family to rethink their portion sizes. And, after almost 100,000 people sign Hugh's letter to the health secretary, he finally gets the interview he has been after for months, discovering some exciting changes that are on the horizon.",
        "British people snack more than any other European country and since the last series aired, lots of people have told Hugh about the foods they find irresistible. To find out more, he runs an experiment to uncover which snacks have Britons hooked and discovers a surprising new theory about one particular combination of ingredients people cannot help but find irresistible.",
        "One of the main drivers of obesity is the simple fact that people are all eating too much. Hugh visits a Torquay family where the father wants help with his diet to stay healthy for his daughters and shift some pounds. Hugh challenges the family to transform their eating habits with a few simple and memorable tricks to reduce the portions on their plates. ",
        "Hugh heads to Westminster with Jamie Oliver to talk to MPs about the obesity crisis. He gets the chance to put his questions directly to the health minister and sees many of the issues he has raised throughout the series addressed in some exciting announcements - but are they going to be enough?",
        "In a final fight back against fat, Hugh sees the 'veg power' advertising campaign go to a whole new level, in the hope it will change kids' attitudes to vegetables once and for all."

        "Fred Sirieix oversees a battle for investment between three restaurant ideas, with each pitcher thinking their take on sustainable dining will secure them the chance for big-money backing to open on the high street.",
        "First, they must pitch to four of the industry’s top investors for the opportunity to open for business in Manchester. The single idea with the most investment potential is given a two-day trial to prove themselves worthy of the money they are seeking. However, only those investors with the most passion and interest in the idea will follow it to Manchester.",
        "Amongst those pitching are friends Abi Glencross, 27, and Sadhbh Moore, 28, looking for £300,000 for their vegetarian cafe-cum-barge, Sustainable Food Story. Abi is a professional stunt woman, grain farmer and scientist, and was the first person in the UK to grow meat in a lab. Sadhbh was raised on a eco-farm in Ireland where she grew and foraged much of the food she ate. They began their supper clubs in July 2017 and are now looking to open their first business, on a barge, with dishes like roasted beetroot, goats cheese, chard and thyme tart on heritage grain pastry.",
        "Also pitching are Liverpool-based friends Dan Cameron, 26, and Josh Lundon, 26, with their Nordic-inspired, hyper-seasonal concept Skaus. They are seeking £210,000. The idea for Nordic-inspired cuisine came from the links Liverpool has with Scandanavia, like the classic stew, Scouse, in a bread bowl – slow braised beef stew, pickled beets and brown butter. They started with a series of pop-up events in April 2017, and have since held a number of very successful residencies around the city. Now they want Skaus to go full-time in its own permanent site.",
        "Finally, plant-based heritage cooking from Indo-Persia and the eastern Mediterranean. Tanya Gohil, 31, is seeking £1million for Devi’s. The name ‘Devi’ comes from the Indian word for goddess, as Tanya dedicates her concept to the women in her family who she calls “the queens of the kitchen”. Devi’s has operated a sell-out weekend stall at Maltby Street Market since January 2015 and various pop-up restaurants across London, as well as hosting Devi's Dining supper clubs in Hackney, with dishes like peshawari cauliflower qorma, sultanas, fried shallot, coconut, and preserved lemon grains. Now she is after £1million to open permanently in central London.",
        "Each of the three ideas pitches to a panel of four investors, all keen to back the next hit sustainable restaurant idea on the high street. Darrel Connell is a partner at Imbiba - an investment firm specialising in investing in high growth leisure and hospitality businesses. Typically, Imbiba invests between £1m to £10m over a period of 5 years, in bars and restaurants that can grow to multiple sites. To date, they have invested over £60m across more than 100 businesses throughout the UK. ",
        "Laura Harper-Hinton is the CEO and creative director of Caravan Restaurants and Coffee Roasters, with five restaurants in London, and a coffee roastery. The business has an annual turnover of £15m. Laura is passionate about supporting the next generation of industry hopefuls, having recently joined a new Hospitality UK Mentor Initiative, with a focus on helping more women into senior positions.",
        "Maria Tamander is a Swedish entrepreneur living in London, who recently bought and refurbished a gastro-pub-hotel, The Cleveland Arms in west London. With big-money backing she is now looking to expand her culinary empire.",
        "Shruti Ajitsaria is an Angel Investor and lawyer who manages a portfolio of private investments. Shruti and her husband hold regular pitch sessions with start-up companies from various sectors, with a view to investing in the most promising. In the restaurant sector she has previously backed JKS restaurants (no longer invested) and Vagabond wines. ",
        "In each episode the winning idea has two days in a brand new 50-seater restaurant, in the heart of Manchester’s bustling bar and restaurant district, to prove that their food, menus, pricing, service, team-management and business plans are worth the big money investment they are asking for.",
        "On the first night they open for a half-price soft launch to the public, and the investors, before being grilled in detail on their numbers and business plans the following morning. ",
        "Finally, they open for a full-priced lunch service, during which the investors must consider whether to invest or not. As the investors are in competition with each other, Fred will set them a deadline by which time they have to return to the restaurant if they intend to invest. ",
        "With final service over, the operators face an anxious wait with Fred to see if anyone returns. All they need is for one investor to walk through the doors and make them an offer, and their business fortunes and restaurant dreams will change forever."

What did it feel like to be at the eye of the storm? What did the events at the time mean to the people caught up in them? Germaine takes us back to those giddy days and reflects with honesty, candour and caustic wit about what it was about then and how it all feels now. A rich seam of archive, including previously unseen footage, and an explosive soundtrack immerses us in those revolutionary times.",
        "Is The Female Eunuch still relevant? Are women and girls today any less slavish when it comes to male approval? And what does Germaine think of Me Too? Germaine Greer: funny, clever, contrary, sensitive and caustic - there is simply no one like her. This film gets to know her."

        "Mark turns to horror and shows how film-makers have devilishly deployed a range of cinematic tricks to exploit our deepest, darkest and most elemental fears. He explores the recurring elements of horror, including the journey, the jump scare, the scary place, the monster and the chase. He reveals how they have been refined and reinvented in films as diverse as the silent classic The Phantom of the Opera, low-budget cult shockers The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and The Evil Dead, and Oscar-winners The Silence of the Lambs and Get Out. Mark analyses the importance of archetypal figures such as the clown, the savant and the 'final girl'. And of course, he celebrates his beloved Exorcist films by examining two unforgettable but very different shock moments in The Exorcist and The Exorcist III.",
        "Ultimately, Mark argues, horror is the most cinematic of genres, because no other kind of film deploys images and sound to such powerful and primal effect."

Denise visits the ward her nan was treated in and hears stories of life in the NHS today from patients and staff there.",
        "The number of people surviving some of the most common types of cancer has doubled since the foundation of National Health Service 70 years ago. Denise meets NHS doctors to hear why that is and meets the patients undergoing groundbreaking anti-cancer treatments."

In this three-part series, cameras are at the heart of the action, following workers across the capital for three years as they race to build the enormous tunnel on time and on budget.",
        "In this second episode, construction begins in the heart of London. Two key connection shafts along the Thames are to be dug to enable the super-sewer to be built. In Battersea, a challenging construction technique called 'diaphragm-walling' is employed to build a massive 90-metre-deep shaft. But these are the deepest tunnels ever dug in London, and with challenging rocks that haven't been disturbed for 52 million years, the digger struggles to cut through the ground.",
        "At Tower Bridge, engineers need to build a cofferdam structure out into the Thames to make enough space for the second shaft. Reclaiming 8,000 square metres of land in central London is a noisy operation, and not all of the neighbours are happy. Finally, with tunnelling about to begin, engineers need to solve the problem of where to put up to 1.5 million tonnes of earth and rubble that excavation will create. They plan to take the earth by barges out of London to Tilbury, but the current dock is too small to deal with the vast amount of dirt that will be excavated. It is decided to build a new dock by positioning a 70-tonne bridge on steel pillars and installing a massive platform."

        "This exclusive documentary follows the culmination of a 32-year fight for justice in a notorious unsolved double child murder. On 9 October 1986, nine-year-old friends Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows went out to play and didn't come home. The whole estate turned out to look for the two girls only to have their hopes dashed when they were found lying dead in undergrowth in Wild Park, on the outskirts of Brighton. Both had been strangled and sexually assaulted.",
        "For their families it was the start of a living hell. Police arrested a man the girls liked and trusted - 20-year-old Russell Bishop - and in 1987 he was put on trial. But the jury took less than two hours to acquit him of the murders. Under the law at the time, Bishop could not be retried even if new evidence were to be found. The families of the murdered girls had to endure years of agony, without any prospect of justice for their lost children. Until 2005, when the double jeopardy law was abolished, rekindling the hopes of the families.",
        "Now police and scientists are using cutting-edge methods to uncover new evidence, which they hope will be enough for the CPS to pursue a fresh prosecution. Following the reinvestigation and proceedings from an early stage, and sharing the experience of the children's families, this film charts the last chance at finally finding justice for Karen and Nicola."

He wants to find out why he and many others don't think they are addicted to alcohol, despite finding it almost impossible to enjoy life without it. Adrian, who drinks almost every day, decides to start a drinking diary and soon finds out his intake is way over the recommended limit. He decides to visit his parents to find out what it was that motivated him to start drinking as a teenager and reveals that sneaking into pubs underage was all about friendship and being part of something, and that the allure of the social side of drinking has never really left him since his teens.",
        "So after drinking far too much for far too long, Adrian decides to get his liver checked out. The results come as a shock and after seeing an addiction therapist Adrian begins to realise that like many other people he needs to do something about his excessive boozing. His big question is does he need to quit completely or can he 'to use the world's most boring phrase drink more responsibly'. His first port of call is old mate Frank Skinner. Frank was a Pernod in the morning bedwetting kind of drinker but quit 30 years ago. His advice to Adrian is unexpected."

        "Sue McHugh, an unassuming and normally shy Dublin housewife, is deeply affected by the tragedy. Spurred into action by the events in Warrington and the hope that she can make a difference, Sue urges people across Ireland to demonstrate that the killings on all sides must stop. But has Sue underestimated the challenge of brokering peace in a community that has known only conflict?",

        "Classical historian Dr Michael Scott takes us on an extraordinary journey through the often-invisible treasures of one of the greatest ancient cities in the world - Istanbul. The city has been at the crossroads of Europe and Asia for over two and a half millennia. From the Greeks and Romans through the Ottomans to the Turks, Istanbul has been fought over, destroyed and rebuilt time after time.",
        "First Michael brings the city's tumultuous history alive in one iconic building - the Hagia Sophia. Built by the Romans, this Christian Cathedral has survived earthquakes, riots, sieges and conquest to become a mosque and now a museum. As Michael explores, he reveals the ingenious solutions that enabled this awe-inspiring church to survive 1,500 years of turmoil. As Istanbul, once known as Constantinople, was built by Emperor Constantine to outdo Rome itself, Michael goes in search of the mighty city the emperor built - Constantinople. Michael discovers that Istanbul is built upon layer upon layer of history and culture, one era's buildings erected on top of the other. With the help of local archaeologists and experts, Michael delves into some surprising spaces, such as the once enormous Hippodrome. It began as a stadium for chariot racing but its foundations were later converted into a huge water cistern to supply the Emperor's Great Palace. Michael wades through its foul-smelling water to uncover the Hippodrome's secrets.",
        "With many of the city's most extraordinary places concealed, out of sight or underground, we turn to the latest 3D-imaging technology to reveal them. Our scanning team help us to see the city as no human eye ever could, peeling back the layers of history, showing how the city has had to reinvent itself over and over through its turbulent past."

        "The second film in this intimate portrait finds Princess Margaret and her husband Anthony Armstrong-Jones at the start of their married life in the early 1960s. At home with celebrities and artists, they are riding the wave of a cultural and sexual revolution that is transforming Britain.",
        "In 1965, they set off on an official royal tour of the United States. From California to small-town Arizona, the royal couple promote Britain by day and party by night. They attend a dinner with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in a world where Hollywood royalty increasingly competes with the real thing. In Britain, the press starts to ask if the extravagant royal tour is a good way to spend public money. The mystique of monarchy is being increasingly undermined by the emergence of a more open and egalitarian society.",
        "In the years that follow, Anthony Armstrong-Jones begins to withdraw from royal duties and the couple lead increasingly separate lives. Press speculation about the state of their marriage intensifies. In the 1970s Margaret retreats more and more to the Caribbean island of Mustique in an attempt to secure a private life. In an era of celebrity gossip and the telephoto lens, her relationship with a younger man and beach parties with rock stars like Mick Jagger lead to ever more press interest. As Britain lurches from one economic crisis to the next, Margaret's Caribbean lifestyle becomes the lightning rod for republican attacks on the monarchy.",
        "In 1978, Margaret reflects changing attitudes sweeping the country and gets a divorce. The rebel royal is now increasingly eclipsed by a new generation of princesses. But in her own way, Princess Margaret helped pave the way for them and for the monarchy of the 21st century.",
        "Contributors include Lady Anne Glenconner, a childhood friend who became her lady-in-waiting, Jane Stevens, one of her closest friends, Basil Charles, the owner of a bar on the Caribbean island of Mustique, David Griffin, Princess Margaret's chauffeur, and Craig Brown, her unofficial biographer."

        "In May 2017, the musician and presenter George Shelley tragically lost his sister in a sudden accident. Harriet Shelley was 21 and her brother's closest confidante. In his first documentary, George courageously opens up about his struggles with grief. ",
        "Having spent the last 12 months struggling to talk about his loss and to deal with it, George embarks on a series of extraordinarily candid and raw discussions with his parents and best friend in a bid to help him cope with, and better understand, the process of grieving. He opens up to them in ways he has never done before and, for the first time, also speaks to other young people who have suffered the loss of a sibling, and to others from his generation who can share advice and guidance about coping mechanisms.",
        "Research suggests that bereavement is linked to high rates of suicide and mental health problems among young people. Bereavement is an extremely important issue because of the enormous and serious impact it has on wider society, especially with people under 30 being renowned for not talking about grief. George explores the relationship between his own grief and mental health. He spiralled into a deep depression when his sister died and discusses some of the revelations he has subsequently discovered about himself following conversations he has had with medical professionals."

        "Simon Reeve embarks on the final leg of his epic four-part journey around the Mediterranean. Taking a ferry across the Strait of Gibraltar, Simon's first stop is Ceuta, a Spanish exclave surrounded by Morocco. This is one of the few land borders between Africa and the European Union. Simon joins the Spanish border police who check engines and even dashboards for stowaways trying to reach Europe. Migrant and refugees attempting to cross Ceuta's fortress border have quadrupled in the last year. Undaunted by Morocco's failure to issue a filming permit, Simon crosses the border as a tourist, tracking down a group of migrants hiding in a forest close to Ceuta. They have travelled thousands of miles, crossing the Sahara to get this far, and now they are just a 20-foot, razor wire fence away from their European dream.",
        "Crossing the Med to Spain, one the busiest shipping lanes in the world, Simon discovers huge numbers of dolphins and even giant whales surviving by dodging the ferries, container ships and oil tankers. Travelling along the southern Spanish coast, Simon takes to air to witness the plastic that forms over a hundred square miles of greenhouses. It is where much of our supermarket fruit and veg are grown, but as Simon discovers it is a massive industry built on the back of a low paid, migrant workforce. Simon travels to the Costa Blanca and the resort of Benidorm. Simon is surprised to learn that high-rise Benidorm is now being hailed as a model of sustainable tourism. The Mediterranean region attracts a third of world tourism and visitor numbers are predicted to rise to half a billion a year by the end of the next decade. Simon travels to a western corner of Corsica, a nature reserve that must be one of the most heavily protected bits of sea on earth, and one of the few places where tourists are actively discouraged from visiting. The park's manager shows Simon the results, taking him for a dive in the fishiest place in the Med. In a sea where over ninety percent of fish stocks are over exploited, it is a beacon of hope."

        "In this episode, the makers discover Luton's glamourous secret. While today the town is famous for its airport, it is a little-known fact that Luton once led the world in hat-making. The team learn how the hat industry was transformed from a small rural craft into a global fashion phenomenon. Even today, every fashionable milliner from Philip Treacy to Stephen Jones goes to Luton for their millinery supplies. Presenter Steph McGovern takes the makers through the ages, and they are guided by Awon Golding, a rising millinery star. ",
        "The makers begin their journey in the 18th century, making a fashionable straw Bergere hat. They sort individual pieces of straw into correct lengths, before plaiting it and hand-stitching it into a bonnet shape. The makers are shocked to learn that this painstaking work was done by children, some as young as 18 months old.",
        "Next, it's the 1920s, when everyone in Britain was wearing a hat. The makers attempt to create a felt 'cloche' and 'trilby'. First, they make coloured dyes for their hats, which proves to be a long, arduous and smelly process. Then, they work against the clock to 'block' felt hats into shape in order to satisfy the massive demands of the era. ",
        "The makers then move into the world of modern-day couture millinery. There are still 17 hat-making businesses in Luton making extraordinary creations and their many high-profile clients include the royal family. Here, the makers are given complete free reign to produce a hat that expresses their personality."

Immersed for months in the BBC and Imperial War Museum archives, Jackson created narratives and strategies regarding how this story should be told. Using only the voices of those involved, the film explores the reality of war on the front line: their attitudes to the conflict, how they ate, rested and formed friendships in those moments between battles, as well as their hopes and dreams for the future. Each frame of the film has been hand-colourised by Jackson's team, the footage 3D-digitised, transformed with modern post-production techniques, enabling these soldiers to walk and talk among us.",
        "Reaching into the mists of time, Jackson aims to give these men voices, investigate the hopes and fears of these veterans that survived and were able to tell their stories, and detail the humility and humanity of those who represented a generation forever changed by the destruction of a global war."

        "Our Classical Century brings together the greatest moments in classical music in Britain over the last 100 years in a four-part series that celebrates moments of extraordinary music ambition and excellence, deep emotion and of great pleasure, and the artists who have brought audiences this music. Over the course of the series, viewers see and hear how, over the past one hundred years, classical music has shown dazzling virtuosity and innovation, and how music provided a unifying soundtrack to the times when national identity and destiny was at stake.",
        "Presented by Suzy Klein and Sir Lenny Henry, this first programme captures the profound influence of the First World War on our classical music - how it affected a generation of musicians and composers and how the music they created became a crucial part of the nation’s sense of identity. From the martial might of Mars in Gustav Holst’s The Planets to the pastoral beauty of Ralph Vaughan Williams’ much-loved The Lark Ascending, this film tells the story of the music which brought together the United Kingdom. ",
        "Suzy and Lenny reveal the phenomenal popularity of the musical extravaganza Hiawatha by the now relatively unknown Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, and examine the enduring impact of the American Jazz Age with George Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue. They also look at how Hubert Parry’s wartime composition to William Blake’s poem Jerusalem became the anthem of the Suffragette movement and at how the opening of Glyndebourne saw the start of a new chapter for opera in Britain."

As a teenager, she was involved in a life-threatening road accident which saw her hospitalised for a year. Then her beloved older brother committed suicide. On both occasions, she relied heavily on her religion to help her cope, finding solace in the support provided by her church congregation.",
        "Part travelogue, part celebrity biography, the programme offers thought-provoking insights into what it means to have faith in the 21st century and is a fascinating tale of joy, hope and spiritual awakening that will resonate with everyone in the build-up to Christmas."

They are also brilliant problem solvers with a love of music and given freedom to roam, thanks to the matriarch, they can thrive in the wild just as their ancient ancestors did. Is it any surprise that Hamish the ram wants to be one? But it's not just about cows. We also discover that chickens use 24 different vocalisations to communicate."

        "Nadiya Hussain was born and brought up in Britain but her family is from Bangladesh. Recently she made a surprise discovery about her DNA that led her first to visit Thailand and Cambodia. Now, on the last leg of her travels, she takes a trip to the remote Himalayan country of Nepal to learn more about its people, places and food as part of her adventure to further explore her identity.",
        "Her journey begins in Kathmandu, where she joins a supper club run by local young foodies who share with her the vastly varied cuisine of their country - from the yak butter devoured by Sherpas in the mountains, to the snails eaten in the southern flood plains. Nadiya then heads to Bhaktapur, a historic city devastated by the earthquake of 2015 that affected eight million people in Nepal. There she meets Rotna, a potter whose home was destroyed. He is set on saving enough money to rebuild it, and to do this he has joined forces with his wife and daughter in a new venture to sell the city's speciality yoghurt in his own handmade pots, which Nadiya tries making. Gaining entry to a closed abbey, Nadiya meets a sect of Buddhist nuns who preach female empowerment and practise kung fu. Inspired by her travels Nadiya makes a dish for the class to say thank you.",
        "Next, Nadiya, conquers her fear of small planes to make it to the Annapurna mountains, where she meets her guide Vidya, who was born and raised more than two and a half thousand metres above sea level. Vidya takes Nadiya on her first trek to the village of Thini, where her relatives welcome them with drinks and snacks to restore them after their walk. Her final destination is a party for a charity that helps children afflicted by the civil war that tore the country apart over a ten-year period."

His timeless story of the friendship between a young boy and a Snowman continues to delight generation after generation with its effortless blend of warmth, humour and sadness.",
        "After creating an instant classic with The Snowman, Briggs disturbed a generation with his anti-nuclear story When the Wind Blows, enthralled kids and adults alike with Fungus the Bogeyman and Father Christmas and, in recent years, moved readers to tears with Ethel & Ernest, a touching account of his parents' life story.",
        "Raymond Briggs has been celebrating the ordinary and making it extraordinary for five decades. And the characters he has created have been both popular and influential. As Nick Park says in the film, he couldn't imagine Wallace and Gromit without the experience of reading Briggs's books. This playful, moving and often emotional portrait is told through interviews with Raymond, specially commissioned animation illustrated by Chris Riddell, and contributions from friends, colleagues and admirers, including Andy Serkis, Nick Park, Steve Bell and Posy Simmonds."

In fact, he wants to show us all that it can stand up to, and even better, any non-vegan meal. He's taking on the anti-vegans, one dish and one challenge at a time as he meets groups of fellow Welsh food fans who all have very different dietary requirements.",

This group of intrepid, subterranean explorers are called to rescue people trapped hundreds of feet beneath the ground and are used to traversing one of the most extreme environments on the planet. This month they are taking part in a big training exercise at the Ogof Ffynnon Ddu. Can Matt make them see the light by cooking a vegan meal that will give them the energy they need to keep them going through the training rescue?"

Before he found fame on an international level, British comedy was an end-of-the-pier kind of affair - but through sheer talent and force of personality, Connolly ploughed a different and deeply personal yet universal approach to comedy and in doing so he changed the face of British comedy forever.",

So say what you like about him, but you can't deny everyone wants to know him. And that is what Made In Scotland is about - it is Billy as you have never seen him before - intimate, deeply personal and very funny.",

        "In the heart of Birmingham, doctors Chris and Xand van Tulleken have set up a unique centre for science. But theirs is no ordinary lab because inside it is crammed with 30 pairs of identical twins! Thanks to their matching DNA, identical twins are the perfect candidates for scientific comparison. Chris and Xand use this principle in The Twinstitute to put contrasting health theories to the test. Pairs of twins are split into two groups and each challenged to carry out a task. The results – from diet tips to health tricks reveal ways we could all make lifestyle improvements. This is 'New Year, new you' tested scientifically.",
        "In this episode, two pairs of identical twins are finding out the best way to learn a language - putting the two most popular styles of learning head to head in self-taught versus taught. With 65% of us saying we would like to be able to speak another language, this test will determine the best way to go about it for you!",
        "Chris has arranged for Des and Tina go back to school to learn a language from scratch. With 30 hours of scheduled lessons over four weeks with a language teacher, they are going to have to make space in their busy schedules for this real-time contact. The pros to this process? Des and Tina are safe in the knowledge that the guidance they are receiving is pre-planned, and they get real time feedback on their pronunciation and progress, but is it all a bit old fashioned?",
        "To find out, Xand has set Nick and Lia loose to see if self-teaching is now advanced enough to take on the teachers. In addition to phrase books, there is now an abundance of options available for the budding linguist, via smart phones, online videos and internet radio. Apps now offer the flexibility to learn whenever and wherever they choose and with millions of us now using them every day, we find out if they can really hold their own against the tried and tested method of face-to face communication. But without a teacher it will take dedication and self-discipline for our twins - is this just too much to achieve alone?",
        "Next is a story that sees Chris and Xand put their identical twin bodies on the line in a quest to look younger. A recent survey suggested that the average woman in Britain spends £1,300 a year trying to reduce the effects of ageing, But in an industry cursed with bad science and outlandish claims, is there a technique that could work? Chris and Xand opt to put two techniques head to head that come from opposite ends of the spectrum. Xand is going to spend a month doing an hour of facial yoga every single day for a month. Although the science of facial yoga is in its infancy, it is touted as being the next big thing. By exercising the face you increase the blood flow to the skin which may be beneficial. In addition, with exercise, comes muscle tone which can lead to a plumper, fuller, more youthful face. And hey, it is free!",
        "Meanwhile Chris is going high-end. He will have a single, one-off but expensive treatment: a vampire facial. Popular with the Kardashians, this extreme makeover is also touted as being effective by some people but to say it is an unusual treatment would be an understatement. At an exclusive Harley Street clinic, Chris first has some of his blood drawn. That blood is then spun at high speeds to separate it out into its constituent parts, before the serum is injected back into his face! The theory is that the serum contains “growth factors” released when the blood was spun at speed. Those growth factors supposedly then cause his skin to regenerate courtesy of the trauma caused by the injections. ",
        "But will either work? To find out the guys have their skin age assessed by a special camera system which will pull no punches in scrutinising every pore! ",
        "Finally this week is a story that involves secret science – a story that we can’t tell our twins about for fear of influencing the result. Can the brightness of a room can affect your appetite? Intriguing new research suggests that we unknowingly eat more when a room is brightly lit and there is good science to support this: in bright light, the brain is super-stimulated and put into a state known as arousal and, according to some, when aroused, we get more greedy. In dim light, the brain is much calmer and with that calmness our greed level drops off. But will that theory stack up in practice? To find out our twins are split into two lunch groups. The first set has their buffet under bright light and the other has the same buffet under dim light. By precisely measuring the amount of food consumed, Chris and Xand are able to work out exactly how many calories each team of twins ate. And the results are simply staggering!",
        "Using the latest science, and bringing a visual flair to health programming, The Twinstitute aims to reveal tips and tricks that can help us all live a healthier life!"

        "There are only ten weeks left before the bears are due to be released into the wilderness, but they are not ready yet. First, they must learn two essential bear survival skills, how to swim and how to forage. Most importantly, they also need to put on enough weight to survive the impending Russian winter alone. Without a mother bear to teach or feed them, it is down to Gordon and the Pazhetnov family of biologists to prepare the orphans for the harsh realities of bear life. ",
        "For this vital part of their development, the Pazhetnovs have designed a special wilderness training zone just outside the enclosure, where they can experience the wild but return to the safety of the enclosure at any time. Gordon opens the gate and the biggest cub Zhora leads the group into the forest. Pasha, the smallest cub, eventually follows - he is the orphan the family are most worried about. Pasha is always at the back and last to feed at any foraging sites. As a result, he is struggling to put on weight. ",
        "As the release date draws nearer, all the cubs undergo a series of challenges to check they are ready to survive in the wild, but will all six of them make it?"

        "The eight families who are following Tom Kerridge's Fresh Start plan have risen to every challenge he has set them, transforming mealtimes at home. Now, as the experiment draws to a close, they're coming together to celebrate their achievements - and to take on Tom's final challenge: cooking generous dishes for groups of friends and family.",
        "Tom kicks things off by cooking beef biryani for his own extended family. With a one-pot wonder like this, the most important thing is to pack in tons of flavour. Tom roasts the mince for the biryani in the oven to maximise the flavour before adding it to the pot. He doesn't hold back on the ginger, garlic and spices either. The finished dish contains around half the calories of a standard takeaway curry and has loads of veg thrown in so there's no need for extra side dishes. ",
        "The Johnson family love hosting parties but are unhappy about the food they usually offer their guests; frozen pizzas and tinned hot dogs were the norm. Now they are throwing their first party since starting Tom's experiment. It's Mum Becky's 40th birthday and they want to serve real, homemade party food. Tom and the Johnsons - including three sons - work as a team to prepare chicken ranch burgers for 20 hungry guests. The recipe can be prepped ahead so the Johnsons have more time to relax and celebrate when friends and family arrive.",
        "Over the last two and a half months, the gang have learnt loads of new cooking techniques. Now Tom wants them to use what they've learnt to be even more ambitious. He is challenging them to make bigger dishes for more people than ever before - to show how delicious food has the power to bring people together. Back in his kitchen, Tom makes a sumptuous chicken, ham and leek Pie - perfect for a large group to share, hot or cold. This is exactly the sort of dish that can transform how Tom's gang cook for their friends and family. ",
        "To mark the end of the experiment and celebrate their achievements, all the families are getting together for a picnic in a few days' time. Tom has asked them all to cook a dish they can bring along and share with the group. And Tom's not going to arrive empty handed either; he's doing his own version of Eton mess, a summer pudding that both kids and adults love. Meringues from scratch and a simple strawberry coulis are things all of us can make - other than that there's not much 'cooking'. This is a dish with lots of separate elements that taste incredible when combined and it's ideal for a summer party.",
        "Meanwhile Tom asks each family to come up with a resolution to take forward now that the experiment is coming to an end; a pledge that's personal to their own experience and will help keep their cooking and eating on track in the months and years ahead. He also asks the gang to take the same set of health and fitness tests as they did at the start, to find out how much progress they've made.",
        "The final day of the experiment comes around and all the Fresh Start gang gather together for a picnic and cricket match. Twelve weeks on they've come a long way - they're all cooking from scratch, eating healthier meals and, importantly, eating together as a family more often. Tom reveals the results of the recent health tests and there's plenty to celebrate; from weight loss and improved fitness to greater happiness. And the families reveal their new resolutions and share the incredible food they've all made.",
        "Cooking and eating together has brought so many positive changes to the lives of these eight families. But the thing Tom's most delighted by is how much happier they all are as a result."

        "In the last 30 years the world's urban areas have almost tripled in size, changing at a rate wildlife has never experienced before. As cities are built, animals are pushed out of their natural homes. Their stories are the most surprising and captivating of all. Today, these 'wild outcasts' find themselves fighting for their place in a land that once belonged to them.",
        "In this episode we feature elephants in Sri Lanka and see that competition between them and humans for land and resources is resulting in deadly territorial conflicts, which demand solutions. And on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica we meet a troop of capuchin monkeys and learn how our behaviour is affecting them, and raising big questions about their future.",
        "But we also discover where we learn to live with wildlife as neighbours, and give it the space and resources it needs, it can thrive. The resulting relationships between human and animals can be mutually beneficial. We meet an Amsterdam heron called Kiri who has been visiting the same house twice a day for the last 17 years, befriending its owner, and the Florida manatees whose population has recovered to such an extent under the guardianship of local human residents that, in recent years, they have been taken off the endangered species list, and contributed to a massive boom in the local tourism industry. We meet the swiftlets who have evolved to live only in people's houses and specially built swiftlet hotels in Indonesia. And the surprising story of a population of tiny foxes on a Californian island whose presence benefits the hardened military personnel of a US naval base.",
        "This hopeful but realistic episode culminates with the return of charismatic ocean giants to the world's most iconic city, as humpback whales breach against the New York skyline."

      "long_synopsis": [
        "It is an unexpected and contrasting journey through America's iconic and varied landscapes as the Mississippi flows from source to mouth. The Mississippi's greatest surprise is its incredible reach. Its fingers stretch into nearly half of the USA, collecting water from 31 states. More than any other, this one river has helped unite the many and varied parts of America. The Mississippi's longest tributary begins life in the depths of winter, in the towering Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Montana. Billions of tonnes of water, ultimately destined to flow south are trapped as ice and snow. Here, its headwaters are a draw for the world's top ice climbers, who celebrate winter with daring climbs up towering frozen waterfalls - surely the most dangerous and spectacular winter faces of the ice-bound Mississippi.",
        "In this frozen wilderness, a handful of tenacious coyotes have learned to fish, in one remarkable Mississippi headwater kept flowing by the steaming geysers of Yellowstone National Park. In the bone-chilling water, the coyotes stand stock still for hours, risking severe hypothermia in the hope of pouncing on a fish. Spring in the Upper Mississippi in Minnesota, arrives on the wings of tens of thousands of white pelicans who bring the river to life. Both comical and beautiful, their crowded flotillas put on balletic, synchronised fishing displays. On the other side of the continent in crystal-clear Appalachian Mountain streams, some devious parents employ the creepiest childcare strategy on earth. Freshwater mussels produce bizarre growths which mimic small fish. These lifelike lures even have false eyes and dance, imitating real fish. Their purpose is to act as living bait, tricking larger predatory fish into attacking them. Once bitten, a cloud of blood-sucking baby mussels clamp onto the unwitting fish's gills. After several weeks of feeding on their victim's body fluids, they drop off and disperse. These sneaky mussels provide their babies with food and transport to different parts of the river. It is a macabre underwater puppet show, made all the more weird as the puppet master (the parent mussel) is blind and has no idea what a fish looks like.",
        "But the spring thaw also means extra work for busy beavers - safe in their cosy lodges all winter, they must now venture out to repair the damage that the rushing meltwater has done to their precious dams. As the river flows south through the central US, it becomes a vital transport link. Special cameras take us on a time-travelling journey down the busiest section of the river. A gigantic boat zooms hundreds of miles downriver in seconds, flashing through night and day. This is the industrial heart of the river. Even here, the river still hosts incredible wildlife spectacles. Each Independence Day, millions of mayflies gather in swarms so large they can be seen on weather radar.",
        "As it flows into the south, it spreads and slows, feeding the largest swamp in the US - the fertile, mysterious Atchafalaya. Over 2,000 square miles of wetlands, where alligators still rule. This is one of the richest and most diverse wilderness regions of the states, - a melting pot where racoons and beavers mix with tropical specialties like roseate spoonbills and emerald-green anole lizards. These back waters are the fabled spirit of the Mississippi made famous by Mark Twain and the Blues. As the massive river nears the ocean, it passes cities that have grown up along its banks - like New Orleans. Here 60 miles of docks make it the largest port in the western hemisphere where goods brought down the Mississippi are transferred to huge ocean going ships.",
        "At the end of its 3,500-mile journey, the Mississippi eventually creates one of the biggest river deltas on the planet. But today this delta is under threat. Damming and controls along the river's length are preventing the Mississippi's natural flood cycles - it can no longer replace land that the ocean washes away. This remarkable delta is home to millions of migrant birds and protects vast areas inland from hurricane surges. Its preservation is key to both the people and the wildlife here. The delta is a landscape built by the river from cornfields in Iowa, mountaisides in the Rockies and sediment from Tennessee streams - all collected and deposited by one huge river which unites and defines one great nation."

        "In this episode, our time-travelling class arrives in 1960. With a brand new decade, comes a new school for our pupils - the secondary modern. Leaving behind the rigidity and formality of the postwar grammar, they are now training for a vocational future. As they experience more hands-on lessons than ever before, our modern students and teachers will find out whether the 60s were really so swinging, after all.",
        "Their first lesson sees the boys and girls separated once again for subjects deemed suitable for each. For the girls this means an introduction to typewriting, and for the boys, bricklaying. As the girls comes to terms with the challenges of carriage-returns and speed typing, to the fast pace of the William Tell overture, the boys attempt to tinkle and tease their way around a trowel, and building a simple wall presents a unique challenge for these modern pupils.",
        "In the secondary modern, though, there was no escaping the basics, as our class discover in maths. One of the few lessons in which boys and girls were mixed, there is widespread confusion as they try to master the complex art of the slide rule - no calculators here! Attempting to get to grips with this cutting-edge technology, they take some time out to prank the teacher and commit the age old trick of defacing the overhead projector.",
        "In 1963, there is rebellion brewing as the girls are told they will be cooking a meal in their very own purpose-built flat. Sampling the menu is their male teacher, acting as a stand-in husband. The recipes include an intoxicating mix of celery boats piped full of paprika and cream cheese, devilled eggs and kippers in butter. And if that is not enough to put them off their lunch, school dinner in the 1960s serves them a hearty 1,500-calorie meal of mince roly-poly, cabbage and mash, spotted dick and of course, the obligatory lumpy school custard. While the girls have been slaving in front of a hot stove, the boys have been learning a skill deemed crucial for male school leavers. Behind the wheel of a Mini, they have been learning to drive for the first time. Watch out Lewis Hamilton!"

But things aren't as bad as they seem and Tom is soon to embark on the most thrilling journey of a lifetime!",

Harish Patel once again features as the ever popular Raj.

Elliot Hegarty is the director, whose past credits include David Walliams' Grandpa's Great Escape, Lovesick, The Middle and Blackish and series two of Bad Education. He also directed the Bad Education Movie.

Concentrating on the communal areas of the house they are have to craft from scratch a heavy metal weather vane, a decorative mirror, write, publish and print their own magazine and create a decorative pergola for the front of the house. All within a week. ",
        "Working together as a group they will see if the arts and crafts philosophies of John Ruskin and William Morris have sunk in, and if living the 1890's communal has helped them to better understand the depth and scale of the arts and crafts movement both as a power for artistic and social change. But will they get it all done in time to celebrate with a ball and fireworks display at the end of their month in the house and will they have learnt anything about what it means to be a creative crafter from their time as a Victorian?"

        "In this live final hosted by Claudia Winkleman and Nick Robinson, the celebrity advocates return to fight their winning icon's case, and the public vote for the person they think was the greatest figure of the 20th century. Further information and debate can be found across the BBC to help viewers decide which of the seven finalists to vote for.",
        "During his illustrious broadcasting career, Sir Trevor McDonald has interviewed many of the top politicians of our time. He argues that 'the ultimate icon should be a political leader due to the commitment of their desire to be of service to their community, to their society, or to their nation'.",
        "Dermot O'Leary believes that it is exploration that has had the most profound effect on the world around us and our place in it: 'Explorers have taken us on a journey from conquest to understanding. The work of explorers has changed how we see our world and ourselves'. ",
        "Chris Packham argues that a scientist should be crowned winner because 'whatever the century threw at us, scientists found a way to save the day. I want to celebrate their genius and show how, through great personal sacrifice, they were able to propel humanity forwards.'",
        "Kathleen Turner wants an entertainer to win the public's vote: 'They may not be leaders - but they still led the way.' She argues that it is the audience that turn entertainers into stars, which makes them 'icons in the truest sense - because they already belong to us'.",
        "Sanjeev Bhaskar is fighting for an activist to be the icon of the 20th century because 'they were trailblazers who gave dignity to the debased and helped move power from the few to the many'. These were people, he says, 'that at great personal cost inspired thousands, millions to do the same as them'.",
        "Clare Balding thinks a sports star should be crowned the public's icon because 'sport (...) is a true meritocracy which rewards achievement without favour or judgement. There are a few individuals in the last century who made the most of their moment in the spotlight to change the world around them and they made a difference to millions of others.'",
        "Lily Cole argues that an artist or writer deserves to be voted the winner: 'I believe good artists - whether film-makers, writers, painters or sculptors - push the boundaries of our culture, reflecting the times and also signposting new directions for society.'",
        "Who will the greatest icon be? Voting opens near the start of the programme and there will be two ways to cast your vote: by telephone (details are outlined during the final) or via the series website. The winner is announced at the end of the final."

        "When Hugo Chavez stormed to power in Venezuela in 1998 he promised to transform the lives of the poor. He was at the helm of the country with the largest proven oil reserves in the world and set about spending Venezuela's vast oil wealth. Around the world he was hailed as a new hope for socialism by left wing politicians, including Ken Livingstone and then back bench Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn. But now 20 years on, 90 per cent of families in Venezuela say they do not have enough to eat and the United Nations predicts that over five million people will have fled the country by the end of 2019.",
        "This film tells the extraordinary story of Chavez's 14-year presidency. A precursor to many of today's populist leaders, Chavez bypassed traditional media and spoke directly to the people through his weekly live TV show. Told by many of those who knew him, it is the story of incredible short-term achievements in health and education, but also of the tragic legacy of his idealism, populism and ruthless pursuit of absolute power. With populist movements increasingly taking power in countries around the world, it is a story that is now more relevant than ever.",

        "Six women lost their lives to a killer who was never caught. Criminologist Professor David Wilson leads an investigation to unmask the killer, who claimed more victims than even his notorious Victorian namesake, Jack the Ripper.",
        "Professor Wilson and his investigative team - which includes former detective Jackie Malton and forensic psychologist Professor Mike Berry - begin their hunt for the killer not in London, but 150 miles away in Abertillery, South Wales. In 1921, the Welsh mining town was devastated by the double murder of two schoolgirls when eight-year-old Freda Brunell and 11-year-old Florence Little were killed just weeks apart by a local boy, 15-year-old Harold Jones, who the Abertillery residents still refer to as their 'Dark Son'.",
        "Those murders - especially the sadistic nature of their deaths and the treatment of the bodies afterwards - have eerie parallels with the 'Jack the Stripper' murders. Could Harold Jones the boy killer really have matured in later life into a serial killer?",
        "To test this theory, the team revisit the scenes of the murders in west London. They use contemporary policing techniques such as geographical and offender profiling to see if the crimes of Jones the boy can be measured against those of Jack the Stripper. And from the outset, it becomes apparent there are many chilling similarities."

        "While the fishing boat Reliance spends the day in port, two of its Ghanaian crewmen take a trip into Peterhead to buy gifts for their families back home. In the evening, the boat heads to the Shetland Isles in search of whitefish and prawns. The boat's nets come up full of mud and sea urchins, which can damage the catch, so skipper John Clarke decides to move to another ground. John's move pays off and he steams home full of prime langoustine and cod. John has been reflecting on the future of his son David, who is hoping to take over as skipper one day. So will John let David take the boat out on his own, and if so, does David think he's ready? On the Amity, skipper Phil Reid tries a new fishing ground to see if he can find a decent catch. But the hauls are disappointing and even a change in the weather conditions doesn't bring a change in fortune. Phil and the crew keep toiling away but return to Peterhead with 200 boxes of fish and just five prawns. On land, Phil has a tense wait at fishing's equivalent of the Oscars to find out if he's won an award for a new kind of net he has developed."

Arriving in Skagway by seaplane from railwayless Juneau, Michael heads first for Dyea and the Chilkoot trail, which the first gold prospectors hiked a hundred years ago to the Klondike. Among them, he discovers, was author Jack London, whose stories of sled dogs captured the spirit of the gold rush.",
        "In the puppy pen of a sled dog training camp, a dog musher tells Michael how huskies helped to build Alaska and gives him a taste of how the dogs continue to work and race today. Boarding the 52-mile railway, built in 1898, which climbs 2,600 feet before dropping to the head of Canada's Lake Bennett, Michael looks forward to beautiful scenery on a railway laden with history. At the lake, Michael meets an indigenous guide to hear of the role of First Nations people in the stampede for gold. In Carcross, Michael explores the art of the First Nations and helps to carve a totem pole. Then he is invited to shake his tail feathers in a 'grouse' dance."

We also meet some comical puffins, spectacular diving gannets and mysterious storm petrels nesting in an ancient Pictish tower. The programme also features stunning scenes of human life, from crofting and boat building to the jaw-dropping Up Helly Aa fire festival with its Viking hordes."

A thousand feet deep and covering two and a half square miles, it is breathtaking and beautiful.",
        "Travelling via Hinton to Jasper Michael learns of the race to lay transcontinental rails through the Rocky Mountains on two different routes and how steel tracks were ripped up during WWI to support the war effort. The chance to observe one of Canada's national emblems in its natural habitat presents itself in Hinton. Michael discovers how the enchanting beaver, once slaughtered for its fur, is now pampered. In the woodland around Hinton Michael marvels at the scale of Canada's forestry industry. He meets one of the area's logging chiefs. With a million hectares to manage he has his work cut out."

Now Danny delves into the lives of his royal and noble forebears to find out how they lived, as he immerses himself in their pursuits, passions and lifestyles. From the Vikings to the Tudors, Danny dresses, eats and lives his way through his family tree. And, remarkably, his journey is a retelling of 800 years of British history, which is all there in his bloodline.",
        "In this episode, Danny's first stop is Edward II and his French wife Isabella whose lives, to Danny's delight, play out like a medieval soap opera. As Danny romps through his family tree he dons 14th-century armour and learns to fight like his 19-times-great-grandfather, famous medieval knight Henry Hotspur Percy. To get closer to his Tudor ancestors Danny brushes up on his etiquette by learning to sing and dance just like one of Henry VIII's courtiers. And finally, Danny gets his hands on a ruff when his own family, in all their Tudor finery, join him at an Elizabethan sugar banquet."

        "Once we believed that art began with the cave paintings of Ice Age Europe, tens of thousands of years ago. But now, extraordinary newdiscoveries around the world are overturning that idea. Antony is going to travel across the globe, and thousands of years back in time, to piece together a new story of how art began. He discovers beautiful, haunting and surprising works of art, deep inside caves across France, Spain and Indonesia, and in Australian rock shelters. He finds images created by hunter-gatherers that surprise him with their tenderness, and affinity with the natural world. He discovers the secrets behind the techniques used by our ancestors to create these paintings. And he meets experts making discoveries that are turning the clock back on when art first began.",
        "Finally Antony asks what these images from millennia ago can tell us - about who we are. As he says, 'If we can look closely at the art of our ancestors, perhaps we will be able to reconnect with something vital that we have lost.\"'."

All of these extraordinary people were children during the Holocaust, but now in their later years, they reflect on their experiences with a different perspective and understanding of how this past trauma permeates through to their contemporary lives with increased significance.",
        "The film is based in the present tense, building a picture of a small number of survivors in their day to day lives, whilst also giving an insight into why they hold on to particular memories of the Holocaust, as well as what concerns them most as they contemplate reaching the end of their lives.",
        "Over the course of a year, director Arthur Cary also follows these individuals on personal and profound journeys - including the story of a man who returns to Auschwitz with his daughter, a German Jewish survivor addressing the Bundestag, and a man who returns to his German childhood hometown for the first time since 1946 to finally acknowledge the death of his little brother. These scenes are punctuated by compelling interviews with a wider group of survivors who reveal shared feelings as well as their own unique thoughts and experiences. Having lived through 'humanity's darkest hour', these are the last survivors."

        "A spectacular aerial journey flying over the world’s longest man-made monument, the Great Wall of China. In classic slow-TV style - without commentary and using authentic location sound - fly 2,500 kilometres along the 2,300-year-old wall, from the Yellow Sea in the crowded east, near Beijing, to the remote Gobi Desert in the west.",
        "This epic adventure explores 20 location highlights of the Unesco World Heritage Site, built by the Ming Dynasty between 1368 and 1644, starting at Old Dragon’s Head on the east coast and ending at the extraordinary Jaiyuguan Fortress - once the gateway into China from the ancient Silk Road trading route.",
        "With the help of informative captions, witness the classic stone, crenellated walls, ramparts and watchtowers, which rise and fall over the high mountain ranges for the first 500 kilometres of the Great Wall, north of Beijing. Highlights include the famous tourist wall of Badaling, which has seen visits from 500 heads of state, including the Queen and US presidents Nixon and Obama. It was the first section of the Great Wall to open to tourists in 1957.",
        "The middle section explores the rarely seen rammed-earth mud wall, built in provinces with few stone or brick resources, which is much more fragile. More than a third of the entire Great Wall has been destroyed by nature, war and progress over the last three centuries. There is a significant meeting of two Chinese icons as the Great Wall crosses the great Yellow River, known as the cradle of Chinese civilisation.",
        "In the final third of the journey, the wall stretches off across desolate floodplains as it starts to border the remote western Gobi Desert. Flying high above one of the last remaining ancient walled towns, its name becomes obvious - Yongtai or ‘Turtle Town’ – as its 17th-century walls and watchtowers resemble the shape of a turtle.",
        "The final dramatic climax comes at the Qilian Gorge, 80 metres above a roaring river, with the snow-capped mountains of the Tibetan plateau in the distance. The end tower is just a few kilometres from the impressive double-walled Jaiyuguan Fortress, whose three gigantic temple towers dominate the landscape, brandishing the words: ‘The First and Greatest Pass under Heaven’. This was the intimidating welcome to all new arrivals entering China from the west along the Silk Road. A Slow Odyssey is a TV first, showing the Great Wall as it has never been seen before – entirely from the air."

He has his crew bail out safely, but figures it is curtains for himself. He gets on the radio, and talks to June, a young American woman working for the USAAF, and they are quite moved by each other's voices. Then he jumps, preferring this to burning up with his plane. He wakes up in the surf. It was his time to die, but there was a mixup in heaven. They couldn't find him in all that fog. By the time his \"Conductor\" catches up with him 20 hours later, Peter and June have met and fallen in love. This changes everything, and since it happened through no fault of his own, Peter figures that heaven owes him a second chance. Heaven agrees to a trial to decide his fate."

        "In Cape Verde - a group of tiny volcanic islands in the Atlantic - Ade visits a community living in the shadow of an active volcano. He also witnesses how solar power is transforming lives by bringing electricity to isolated communities.",
        "Ade's next stop is Senegal. Here he visits Goree Island - a former staging post in the transatlantic slave trade. He then travels down the coast to a fishing village, where he hears that much of Senegal’s catch is being taken by foreign companies and turned into fishmeal to feed western livestock. Making a last stop on his journey through Senegal, Ade visits Lake Retba where he joins the workers who wade through the lake gathering salt which they sell for less than half a penny a kilogram. Ade’s host has tried to escape poverty by migrating to Europe, but - like so many others - he never got further than the horrors of the camps in Libya.",
        "In the Ivory Coast, Ade meets more people who share the dream of getting to Europe. This time, however, they are footballers training to become professionals in Europe’s big leagues. But it does not always work out, as many are scammed into giving their cash to dodgy football agents.",
        "The final stop is Nigeria, the country Ade was born in. In Lagos he meets some old friends who play para soccer, and he also visits the largest church building on the planet. Traveling out of Lagos, he discovers a country in chaos. Under armed escort, he hears about a conflict that has created hundreds of thousands refugees, but barely been reported on in the west. He finishes his journey at Nigeria’s equivalent to Silicon Valley – a company that believes tech can transform the continent."

        "Following on from the Bafta-nominated Behind Closed Doors, documentary-maker Anna Hall's latest film goes into uncharted territory in which she finds children who have witnessed domestic abuse and then asks them what happened to them.",
        "In this film, four children go on camera to talk about what they witnessed and experienced, and the ongoing effect this has on them. ",
        "Working with charities and Oxfordshire social services for over two years, this film has painstakingly worked with the children and their families to explore the importance of listening to the child and never ever thinking that just because a child's not in the room, that they don't hear or understand what's going on.",
        "Cat Lewis, social worker at Oxfordshire social services says: 'I think you need to realise that even if you're having an argument and there's no physical violence, your kids will know. And lots of parents say, 'Oh they weren't in the room, they were asleep, they didn't hear it, they didn't know'. They did. They know. Children are very very in tune to what is happening around them and we lose a lot of that intuition as we become adults and life gets in the way. If you are at that stage of your relationship where you cannot communicate properly, then seriously you need to think about not being in that relationship. Because your children's lives will be affected forever'.",
        "One in five children in the UK have lived with an adult who is, or has been, a domestic abuser.",
        "All the latest research shows that witnessing domestic abuse in childhood affects a child forever."

Lady Asquith is especially disapproving, since her father, Prime Minister Herbert Henry Asquith, was targeted by the suffragettes. Despite this, Lady Stocks speaks highly of Emmeline Pankhurst and was one of the few to have heard her speak. (1968)"

        "First transmitted in 1958, Mr and Mrs Findlater take a light-hearted look at the daily routines of three other married couples. They follow the wives as they carry out domestic duties and the husbands at work, described as 'a club, no women admitted', a view reinforced by their lunches! Each shares their feelings about their roles and marriage. Young Mrs Coppard jokes about escaping abroad, while older Mrs Gyle-Thompson reflects on the changes she has undergone. Mr Clark, the husband with the lowest income, describes why he's content and wouldn't swap his wife for anyone. Some interesting interviews are also captured in the pub one Sunday."

From the richness of the Cape of Good Hope to blizzards in the high Atlas Mountains, from the brooding jungles of the Congo to the steaming swamps and misty savannahs, Africa explores the whole continent. An astonishing array of previously unknown places are revealed along with bizarre new creatures and extraordinary behaviours.",

The journey begins in the Kalahari, Africa's ancient southwest corner, where two extraordinary deserts sit side by side and even the most familiar of its creatures have developed ingenious survival techniques. Black rhinos reveal a lighter side to their character as they gather around a secret waterhole. Springbok celebrate the arrival of rains with a display of 'pronking'. Bull desert giraffes endure ferocious battles for territory in a dry river bed."

In the first of this two-part series, Bill retraces Wallace's explorations from the jungles of Borneo to the exotic islands of Indonesia, encountering orangutans, flying frogs and extraordinary bugs, on a mission to understand how Wallace came up with the theory of evolution and to win him the recognition he deserves."

Wildlife camerawoman Justine Evans and the science team head to the tangled jungles of northern Burma, one of the largest swathes of unbroken forest in Southeast Asia. Wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan heads to the only other place in Burma where tigers may still exist, the far south. The forests of Karen State were once home to a thriving population of tigers, but this region has been isolated by war for over 60 years and little is known about the fate of the animals. ",

        "Professor Jim Al-Khalili tells the story of how we went from thinking we were close to a complete understanding of the universe to realising we had seen almost none of it. Today, our best estimate is that more than 99 per cent of the cosmos is hidden in the dark, invisible to our telescopes and beyond our comprehension. ",
        "The first hints that there might be more out there than meets the eye emerged from the gloom in 1846 with the discovery of the planet Neptune. It was hard to find, because at four billion kilometres from the sun there was precious little light to illuminate it and, like 89 per cent of all the atoms in the universe, it gives off almost no light. ",
        "In the middle of the 20th century scientists discovered something even stranger - dark matter - stuff that wasn't just unseen, it was fundamentally un-seeable. In fact, to explain how galaxies are held together and how they formed in the first place, there needed to be four times as much dark matter as there was normal atomic matter. ",
        "In the late 1990s scientists trying to measure precisely how much dark matter there was in the universe discovered something even more elusive out there - dark energy, a mysterious new force driving the universe apart that is thought to make up a colossal 73 per cent of it. ",
        "Finally, Jim explores the quest to uncover the nature of dark energy and to see dark matter pull the first stars and galaxies together, a quest that involves peering into the darkest period in the cosmos's past."

He served as an infantryman in France from November 1914 until September 1916, when he was commissioned to the Royal Flying Corps as a temporary second lieutenant. This was his calling. Norman describes one particular strafing mission at Passchendaele that became the most thrilling flight of his life.",
        "With a natural flair for manoeuvres and for developing his own combat techniques, Norman excelled in what was a very lonely and terrifying task. The skies of Passchendaele were also the stage for dogfights, and with incredible detail Norman recalls tactics that scattered seven German Albatross Scout planes and shot down their leader. ",

Simon visits the Rama-Kriol people who face losing their ancestral homes and, in the nearby town of Bluefields, he meets the city-dwellers who believe the canal will bring long-hoped-for prosperity and wealth to the country.",

Back on shore, Simon discovers Hondurans living in the grip of some of the most violent criminal gangs in the world. San Pedro Sula, the country's second city, has the world's highest murder rate.",
        "Simon's journey ends in the stunning Jamaica, where he discovers a country confronting its violent reputation head-on with a police force cracking down on corruption. Here, he spends time with young people who have rejected gang life, offering a model of hope for future generations."

Turing's computers in the 1940s and 1950s were 'first-generation' machines; now computer scientists are working on the 'fifth generation'. In Scotland the institute named after Turing has a world reputation in artificial intelligence work, but its software products are hardly used in the UK.",

With the scores level at 17-17, the winner of the final frame in this best of 35 match would be crowned World Champion. Steve Davis, ranked number one in the world and the reigning champion, had started in ruthless fashion, racing towards an 8-0 lead. But he faced a determined comeback from Dennis Taylor, ranked number 11 and a losing finalist six years previously. Now, after some 14 hours of play in the final, the scores were even with the one frame remaining. The match gripped the British sport-watching population to the extent that 18.5 million were still tuned in as the marathon game played out past midnight on BBC Two."

        "It shows that what has happened is that all of us in the West - not just the politicians and the journalists and the experts, but we ourselves - have retreated into a simplified, and often completely fake version of the world. But because it is all around us we accept it as normal.",
        "But there is another world outside. Forces that politicians tried to forget and bury forty years ago - that then festered and mutated - but which are now turning on us with a vengeful fury. Piercing though the wall of our fake world."

He heads into the office to make another tedious presentation and is confronted by the harsh reality of #IsThatAllThereIs? By the time Kerry arrives at his desk for her daily flirtation/power games, Dane knows for sure that he's had enough. But just as he thinks he's reached the end of the road, Stefan presents him with a new beginning."

        "In recent years, our knowledge of life beneath the waves has been transformed. Using cutting-edge technology in this extended special we celebrate the highlights from the series. From the intense heat of the tropics to our planet's frozen poles, through to its unexplored depths, we reveal new worlds and extraordinary never-seen-before animal behaviours.",
        "Starting in the tropical coral reefs - the most diverse ocean habitat - a tusk fish demonstrates a surprising level of ingenuity - tool use - as it uses corals as an anvil to break open clams. In the Seychelles, half a million terns nest on an island. Fledglings must eventually take to the wing, but danger lurks beneath the waves: metre-long giant trevally fish leap clear out of the water to snatch birds on the wing.",
        "In the tropics sun heats the sea, creating rain, winds and huge storms that drive up towards higher latitudes. Here the seas change with the seasons. In spring thousands of mobula rays gather in Mexico's Sea of Cortez. At night, in a previously unseen event, tiny organisms that light up when disturbed react to their wingbeats, creating an enchanting bioluminescent firework display.",
        "The seasonal seas are home to bountiful kelp forests. In the undersea forests of southern Africa, one resident - the common octopus- has become the ultimate escape artist. To outwit her nemesis, the pyjama shark, she uses ingenious tactics, never filmed before. ",
        "On the coast, two worlds collide. Where sea meets land, coasts are the most dynamic and challenging habitats in the ocean. The ever-changing tides create rock pools. But these temporary worlds are a battleground. Predatory starfish turn a magical garden into the stuff of nightmares.",
        "The big blue is the world's greatest wilderness - it's a vast marine desert where there is little to eat and nowhere to hide. Sometimes there is a brief explosion of food in this marine desert, but ocean hunters must be fast to make the best of this bonanza. We witness super-pods of up to five thousand spinner dolphins racing to herd vast shoals of lanternfish, briefly caught at the surface where it is thought they spawn. New aerial footage reveals, for the first time, the spectacular feeding frenzy of 90kg tuna and dolphins smashing through the lantern fish shoals turning the sea white with foam.",
        "The deep is perhaps the most hostile environment on Earth, at least to us - a world of crushing pressure, brutal cold and utter darkness. We have barely begun to explore it and yet it is the largest living space on our blue planet, home to strange worlds like methane volcanoes and undersea lakes of salty brine. But life adapts in ingenious ways, like the sea toad - a fish that walks instead of swims. And barrel-eye - a deep sea fish with a translucent skull so that it can see through the top of its head to make the most of any glimmer of light.",
        "The deep is more closely connected to our own world than we ever thought possible due to giant ocean currents. We join these ocean currents as they begin their lives in Antarctica and flow from the poles to the tropics and back again, linking every ocean. Ocean currents move heat around our planet and maintain a climate favourable for life. But our ocean system, in relative equilibrium for millennia, is changing at a worrying rate.",
        "Deep in the polar north, we meet walrus mothers and their newborn calves, searching for an ice floe to rest on; but with rising temperatures, summer sea ice is retreating- their battles to survive are becoming ever harder. As we begin to understand the true complexity of the lives of our ocean creatures so do we recognise the fragility of their home."

        "Would you eat insects to save the planet? Adele Roberts takes on a 7 day bug eating challenge to see if the UK's grubby new food trend will catch on.",
        "Forget clean eating – the new food trend on the UK’s plates is grubby. Packed with protein and easy to farm sustainably, eating insects is starting to become more popular in the UK, with supermarkets selling edible insects for the first time. But can Adele Roberts put her morals where her mouth are and eat bugs every day for a week?",
        "Along the way she meets Cambridge University zoologist Charlotte Payne, who explains the environmental problems with the way we farm meat and how insects might solve these problems.",
        "Inspired by the environmental benefits, can Adele get over her squeamishness and start cooking? With grasshoppers and scrambled eggs, cricket and mealworm pasta, and cricket powder truffles on the menu, can they ever taste good? Seb Holmes a Thai street food chef who runs an award-winning non-insect-based restaurant and has helped develop insect products for the high street, steps in to help.",
        "Adele travels to Holland to meet the world's largest producer of buffalo worms for human consumption, visiting a futuristic factory with over 8 billion insects and meeting the people pioneering products made from insect ingredients for the mass market.",
        "Finally, can she convince her girlfriend Kate and Radio 1's Scott Mills to join her on her quest?"

        "Fourteen Days in May is a countdown to an execution, revealing the effect on prison staff and other death-row inmates as time runs out for one young man. (1987)",
        "This documentary is part of Louis Theroux: Docs That Made Me, a collection of Louis favourite documentaries.Among documentary makers, Fourteen Days in May is heralded as a powerful and important piece of storytelling. Louis notes the way the story is told dispassionately until the moment when filmmakers 'break the fourth wall' and say goodbye to the condemned man, Edward Earl Johnson. Under normal circumstances, this tonal shift would be seen as an error of judgment but here it's an enormously emotional moment. The grammar of interviewing and filmmaking is turned on its head as a man faces execution."

The residents have created a barricade to show their determination that they won't be moved to make way for the estate to be renovated, afraid that they might never get back into their homes if forced out. The situation has been getting national media coverage and everyone involved is on edge, including the police.",
        "While all this is happening, Mairead has been sick for weeks and has to be taken to hospital - a place Conor and Jock hate. The situation proves to be more serious than thought, causing major concern for the lads. Not knowing how to help, the lads ask Mairead if there's anything they can get her. Mairead says she's never seen a white Christmas, so the two friends set off on a chaotic adventure to try make her wish come true, which involves some accidental interaction with a local film crew - and a movie star - who ends up getting involved.",
        "When Billy Murphy enters the fray, all hell breaks loose. But the lads are determined to do something for Mairead, and in the process find out something about themselves and the value of empathy."

        "Simon Schama begins Civilisations with this premise: that it is in art - the play of the creative imagination - that humanity expresses its most essential self: the power to break the tyranny of the humdrum, the grind of everyday. Art makes life worth living and is the great window into human potential. And societies become civilised to the extent that they take culture as seriously as the prosecution of power or the accumulation of wealth. But in the century of total war and industrial slaughter, was (and is) that enough? ",
        "The cause of humanity went up in the smoke of the Nazi crematoria. Horror and terror brushed beauty aside and stamped on its pretensions. In the modern world, art has become increasingly commodified. Simon's last programme explores the fate of art in the machine- and profit-driven world. It looks at the rise of art as a tradeable commodity and turns on one central question. Should art create a realm separate from the modern world, a place where we can escape and pull the ladder up after us? Or should it plunge headlong into the chaos and cacophony while transforming the way we see it and live in it?",
        "Using the works of both dead and contemporary artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, Simon seeks answers to these profound questions. His conclusion is imbued with hope: despite all the travails of the present, by engaging with the here-and-now, art still offers civilisation an insight into the incomprehensibility of the world and a way to transcend its horrors with the enduring creativity of the human spirit."

        "When Mim was just six months old his mother left his father in the West Midlands, taking Mim with her to south London. Mim never saw or heard from his father again. He grew up surrounded by his mother's family, with barely a mention of his father. They have no idea where he is or whether he is alive or dead. Mim's mother has suffered from mental health problems all her life and it has been impossible for Mim to ask her about his father.",
        "In this film Mim embarks on a deeply personal journey, delving into his family history to discover the truth of what happened to his parents' marriage. His main quest is to find his dad and ask him why his mother had to leave all those years ago - and why he's never been in touch.",
        "Information on his father is almost non-existent. Mim starts his search with three photos of his dad taken in 1991 that he's never seen before. Speaking for the first time to close family members about his parents' marriage, he begins to build a picture of his father's character. As he delves deeper into his father's story, he discovers his dad is far older than he expected - he fears that he may have died and his search will be in vain.",
        "His search takes him to Dudley, which is where he was born and which is his dad's last known location. But every lead turns out to be a dead end, until he meets a group of his dad's old friends who break his case wide open. Mim sets out on an unforgettable global journey to finally get the answers he's been wanting for 26 years."

        "After Luke McQueen's two previous pilots ended in disaster, thanks largely to his own self-destructive tendencies, his producers decide to try a format that requires absolutely no talent from him - a reality dating show. Inspired by Love Island and other dating shows, their hope is that his questionable behaviour might actually provide some genuine entertainment.",
        "Blissfully unaware of their motives, Luke is excited at the prospect of a dating show and a shot at true love. Having read that most women look for a good sense of humour above all else in a partner Luke sets out to prove this theory with a format that offers six lucky women the chance to win the ultimate prize - a comedian for a boyfriend.",
        "Once he finds himself in a mansion with six girls, things start to unfurl as his abandonment issues come to fore and it becomes clear that despite the aim of the game, he doesn't want to let any of the girls go. Can Luke get over his nerves and seduce them with laughter? Can the girls handle the somewhat unorthodox dating challenges? Most importantly though, can Luke pull off the white skinny jeans look?"

And now, she has four tiny newborn cubs to care for. They are the future of her dynasty. But the idyllic world that she inhabits is changing. ",
        "Rival tigers, seeking their own territory, are encroaching on her hunting lands. One in particular, her adult daughter Solo, is challenging Raj Bhera in the heart of her territory. The powerful tigress must fight to retain control of these hunting grounds while continuing to feed and protect her growing cubs. ",
        "Solo's persistence puts pressure on the whole family, until Raj Bhera makes a decision that could end both her life and her dynasty forever."

Still, his parents continue to push him towards becoming a doctor, while his relationship with Layla looks shaky and confusing. Kazim has now decided to look for a new job, but an interview with an unlikely employer takes a bad turn. As he prepares to move out of his mum's house he has one final bittersweet dance with her. His father, however, is less than warm. He and Jeremiah must meet with Fatima for one last time and report the truth about Speedi-Kazz. ",

Can Speedi-Kazz move forward as a company? Even when the future starts to look brighter, a figure from the past threatens to shakes things up..."

        "Is Britain being duped by 'fake homeless', people posing as destitute to boost takings? Or is this a scare story to demonise the real homeless?. ",
        "The number of people sleeping rough in England is at a record-high - a 73% increase over the last three years. Government data shows that on any night in autumn 2017, nearly 5,000 people were recorded sleeping on the streets, a figure that has more than doubled since 2010. But there are claims that the UK has a problem with 'fake homeless' begging on the street. These are people who have homes, but still go out onto the streets to beg. News stories of scammers are frequent, and some police records show that 80% of people begging have 'some kind of home' to go to. ",
        "In Cambridgeshire, the police practice a 'zero tolerance' attitude to people begging, sending them for sentencing at a magistrates court. ",
        "In Devon, Ashley Sims photographs, investigates and then shames fake homeless people. He claims he has cut the number of homeless in Torbay from 23 to just 6, as all the 'fake homeless' have been driven out after being exposed. Ashley has been branded a 'homeless vigilante' by the press. ",
        "In Liverpool one business owner claims every beggar outside his pubs and clubs is fake homeless. Homeless charities argue that some individuals may well have homes, but that they have complex and chaotic lives that may have led to them begging on the streets. They argue that people like Ashley are demonising the homeless population, who already face a lack of trust and abuse from the public. ",

Jean Valjean arrives at the barricade to find Marius, conflicted over his feelings about the man who promises to take Cosette from him. Valjean's heroic efforts to keep the soldiers back are applauded by his new comrades. Meeting each other again, the captured Javert is left baffled and infuriated by Valjean's behaviour towards him.",

        "Believing he is doing the best for his adoptive daughter, Jean Valjean makes a heartbreaking decision, but underestimates the depth of the love of those closest to him."

        "2018 saw the downfall of a series of famous men in the face of allegations of sexual harassment. The issue has never received so much media attention, but the debate about what is and isn't appropriate in the workplace continues. A hand on someone's back, complimenting their fragrance - is this a colleague being friendly, or are they crossing a line? What constitutes sexual harassment?",
        "To find out, BBC Three conduct a social experiment, hosted by journalist and presenter Ben Zand. They bring together 20 people between the ages of 18-30 to see if they understand the rules of behaviour in the workplace. Over the course of two days, they watch a specially written drama in three parts telling the story of a professional relationship between a man and woman at work which ends with an accusation of sexual harassment. At each stage, the group are given the opportunity to vote on the behaviour displayed and if it is offensive or unwanted, before finally voting if they believe it constitutes sexual harassment.",
        "They also hear directly from people whose lives have been affected by sexual harassment, including a false accusation of harassment.",
        "The debate between the young people is wide ranging and impassioned. The programme reveals just how much confusion and disagreement there is when it comes to specifying exactly where a line should be drawn - a line which can become blurred. It shows the significant differences that exist between the genders when it comes to their perspective on what is acceptable.",
        "And finally, the group hears from a barrister who lays down the law and answers the question posed by the drama - is this sexual harassment?"

Despite this fact, Saudi-born, British fashion stylist Basma Khalifa has been persuaded to travel back to Saudi Arabia - a country she hasn't been to since her parents moved to Northern Ireland when she was three years old. Although she grew up Northern Ireland, she's never felt totally at home in the UK. Maybe she can start a new chapter of her life in Saudi Arabia which has become more open under the new crown prince. But just a few days after arriving in the country, the news breaks of the murder of the Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and her experiment takes on a darker turn.",
        "Basma travels to Jeddah - Saudi Arabia's more 'liberal' city - and moves in with her three aunts. She immerses herself in Saudi Arabian life, but the strict laws and social codes aren't easy for her to stomach. Basma struggles with how to behave in public and what to wear and with every slip-up, she comes head to head with the Saudi Arabian government minder who has been assigned to monitor her movements. Just when she is starting to think she can't take it anymore, she discovers Jeddah's underground party scene and she feels more at ease. A spiritual journey to Mecca seals her newfound faith in Saudi Arabia, and she's hungry to see what else it has to offer her. Since June 2018, women in Saudi Arabia have been allowed to drive and Basma wants to try it for herself. Despite her aunt's warnings that it could jeopardise her whole visit, Basma decides to go ahead and rent a car, and everything goes well until Basma mentions the name of a female right-to-drive campaigner who the Saudi Arabian government has put in prison. ",
        "With a unique and unprecedented insight into real Saudi Arabian life through her family, Basma is ready to finally see whether she could permanently return to her native country."
